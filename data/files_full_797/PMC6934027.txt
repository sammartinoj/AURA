In the originally published version of this article an error appeared in the section Exposures, which began “Prevalence of chronic disease was identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions (ICD 9 and 10) primary and secondary diagnoses from hospital admission data in England, Scotland and Wales and cancer registry data from 1997 up to accelerometer wear time for each individual (2010–13).”

However (2010-13) should have read (2013-2015). This has now been corrected.
