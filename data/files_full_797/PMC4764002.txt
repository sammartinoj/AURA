Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) occur in 70-90% of patients at different stages of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), but the available methods for managing these problems are of limited effectiveness.

Aim
Assess the effects of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), on BPSD and cognitive function in persons with AD.

Methods
Fifty-four patients with AD and accompanying BPSD were randomly divided into an intervention group (n=27) and a control group (n=27). In addition to standard antipsychotic treatment, the intervention group was treated with 20Hz rTMS five days a week for four weeks, while the control group was treated with sham rTMS.The Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog), and the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) were administered by raters who were blind to the group assignment of patients before and after four weeks of treatment.

Results
Twenty-six subjects from each group completed the study. After four weeks of antipsychotic treatment with adjunctive real or sham rTMS treatment, the mean (sd) total BEHAVE-AD scores and mean total ADAS-Cog scores of both groups significantly decreased from baseline. After adjusting for baseline values, the intervention group had significantly lower scores (i.e., greater improvement) than the control group on the BEHAVE-AD total score, on five of the seven BEHAVE-AD factor scores (activity disturbances, diurnal rhythm, aggressiveness, affective disturbances, anxieties and phobias), on the ADAS-Cog total score, and on all four ADAS-Cog factor scores (memory, language, constructional praxis, and attention). The proportion of individuals whose behavioral symptoms met a predetermined level of improvement (i.e., a drop in BEHAVE-AD total score of > 30% from baseline) in the intervention group was greater than that in the control group (73.1% vs.42.3%, X2=5.04, p=0.025).

Conclusion
Compared to treatment of AD with low-dose antipsychotic medications alone, the combination of low-dose antipsychotic medication with adjunctive treatment with high frequency rTMS can significantly improve both cognitive functioning and the behavioral and psychological symptoms that often accompany AD.

背景
：70-90%的阿尔茨海默氏病(Alzheimer's Disease, AD)患者在不同阶段都伴有痴呆的精神与行为症状(behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, BPSD), 但现有的针对这些问题的方法疗效十分有限。

目的
评估对AD患者的左背外侧前额叶皮层(left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC)进行高频重复经颅磁刺激(repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, rTMS)对其BPSD和认知功能的疗效。

方法
将54例伴有BPSD的AD患者随机分为干预组(n=27)和对照组(n=27)。在常规抗精神病药物治疗的基础上, 干预组采用20 Hz的rTMS治疗, 每周五天, 共四周;而对照组采用伪磁刺激治疗。评估者采用阿尔茨海默病行为病理学评定量表(Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale, BEHAVE-AD)、阿尔茨海默氏病评估量表-认知分量表(Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive, ADAS-Cog)和副反应量表(Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale, TESS)对患者分别在4周治疗期前后进行盲法评估。

结果
每组都有26例患者完成了研究。抗精神病药治疗辅以磁刺激或伪磁刺激治疗4周后, 两组BEHAVEAD总分的均值(标准差)和ADAS-Cog总分的均值与基线相比均显著降低。校正基线值后, 干预组的BEHAVE-AD总分、BEHAVE-AD的7个因子分中5个(活动障碍、昼夜节律、攻击性、情感障碍、焦虑和恐惧)、ADAS总分以及ADAS量表4个因子分(记忆、语言、结构性练习、注意力)均显著低于对照组(即改善更明显)。事先将BEHAVE-AD总分比基线下降大于等于30%定义为症状改善, 干预组中行为症状改善的患者比例显著高于对照组(73.1% vs.42.3%, X2=5.04, p=0.025)。

结论
相较于单纯低剂量抗精神病药物治疗, 高频rTMS辅助低剂量抗精神病药物治疗能显著改善AD患者的认知功能和精神行为症状。

==== Body
1. Introduction
In China the prevalence of senile dementia in persons
60 years of age and older is reported to be 4.8%.[1]
Dramatic improvements in health in China and the one
child per family policy have resulted in a rapid increase
in the proportion of the population that is elderly, and, 
thus, a similarly dramatic increase in the number of
individuals with dementia. As the most common type of
senile dementia, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has become
a serious public health problem. AD is a primary
degenerative cerebral disease of unknown etiology with
a predominant clinical picture of cognitive impairment
and different degrees of behavioral and psychological
symptoms of dementia (BPSD). The incidence of BPSD
during different stages of AD is 70-90%, [2, 3] and primarily
consists of hallucinations, delusions, agitation, and
behavioral disorders. Moreover, BPSD can exacerbate
the cognitive and social dysfunction of AD, leading
to decreased quality of life for both patients and
caregivers, more frequent hospitalizations, and a higher
burden of illness.

Currently, the management of BPSD usually
involves the use of atypical antipsychotic medications
at 1/3-1/2 the dosage recommended for primary
psychosis.[4, 5] However, over the last decade several
studies have reported increased rates of severe adverse
reactions in AD patients treated with antipsychotic
medications, primarily cardiovascular events and
respiratory infections.[6] This has resulted in the
increased use of other, non-pharmacological methods
for managing BPSD, such as physical therapy.[7] Another
alternative approach to BPSD might be the use of
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a
painless, non-invasive treatment that has been shown
to be safe and effective for various neurological and
psychiatric conditions.[8, 9] rTMS has a beneficial effect in
the treatment of different mental disorders associated
with the persistence of auditory hallucinations, 
agitation, anxiety, and depression; and it is associated
with improved cognitive functioning.[10, 11, 12] Recent studies
have shown that rTMS can delay the progression and
improve cognitive function in AD without inducing
any serious adverse events.[13, 14, 15, 16] But there have been
few studies that assess the effects of rTMS on BPSD in
persons with AD. The purpose of this study is to assess
whether or not rTMS used as an adjunctive treatment to
low-dose risperidone can improve the BPSD symptoms
and cognitive functioning of individuals with AD.

2. Participants and methods
2.1 Participants
The recruitment and research procedures are shown
in Figure 1. Participants in this study were recruited
from the Alzheimer’s Disease Treatment Center at
The Wuxi Mental Health Center from August 2013 to December 2014. Inclusion criteria were as foIlows:
a) met the criteria for probable AD proposed by the
National Institute of Neurological and Communicative
Disease and Stroke and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA);[17] b) 60-80
years of age; c) minimum of 5 years of education; d)
total score on Mini-Mental State Examination(MMSE)[18]
of less than 24; e) total score on Behavioral Pathology
in Alzheimer’s Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD)[19] of
greater than 8; e) no history of epilepsy, stroke, or major
head trauma; f) no severe physical illness or implants
which could limit the use of rTMS; and g) had not taken
antipsychotic medications or other drugs affecting
mental activity in the previous month.

Figure 1. Flowchart of the study

Figure 1Fifty-four patients who met these inclusion criteria
were randomly assigned (using a standard table of
random numbers) before the commencement of the
trial to either the intervention group or the control
group. As shown in Table 1, there were no statistically
significant differences between the two groups at
baseline in age, gender distribution, educational level, 
course of the disease, or MMSE score.

2.2 Intervention
This was a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled
study in which the rTMS therapist (who was not
involved in the clinical assessment of the patients) used
a random number table to assign subjects to either
the real rTMS or the sham rTMS condition. In addition
to conventional treatment with risperidone 1 mg per
day, all patients were administered real or sham rTMS
treatments for a total of 20 sessions, 5 days a week for 4
consecutive weeks. Other antipsychotic drugs were not
used during the treatment.

A MagproR30 rTMS machine (with the figure-eight
electromagnet) manufactured by Medtronic (a Danish
company) was employed in the study. Patients lay
down on a treatment table during the rTMS procedure.
The stimulation position was over the left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).[11] The stimulus intensity was
80% of the motor threshold (MT) and the frequency
was 20 Hz for all patients. The total number of pulses
was 1200 for a single treatment session. In the control
group, the coils were turned 180 degrees so the
magnetic field penetrating the brain was so weak that it
was considered a sham condition; other settings were
the same as those used in the intervention group.

2.3 Assessments
The primary outcome measure was the change in
scores of the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer’s
Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD).[19] A secondary
outcome was the change in scores of the Alzheimer’s
Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADASCog).[20] BEHAVE-AD scores and ADAS-Cog scores were
rated at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment. The
ratings were conducted by two attending-physician
level psychiatrists who had been trained in the use of
the scales and who were blind to the treatment status
of the patients; their inter-rater reliability based on
the simultaneous assessment of six patients was good
(ICC=0.79-0.86). The percent reduction from baseline
in the BEHAVE-AD total score was used to assess the
effectiveness of treatment: based on cutoff scores used
in a previous study,[21] those with ≥60% reduction were
classified as ‘effectively treated’; those with 30-59%
reduction were classified as ‘improved’; and those with
< 30% reduction were classified as ‘not improved’.

BEHAVE-AD is a 25-item scale that assesses seven
aspects of behavioral pathology including delusions and
paranoid ideation, hallucinations, activity disturbances, 
aggressiveness, diurnal rhythm disturbances, affective
disturbances, and anxieties and phobias; the range in
scores is from 0 to 75, with lower scores representing
better functioning. ADAS-Cog is a 12-item scale that
assesses four aspects of cognitive functioning including
memory, language, constructional praxis, and attention;
the range in the total score is from 0 to 75, with lower
scores representing better functioning.

Vital signs and adverse events were recorded at the
time of each rTMS treatment. Routine blood tests, urine tests, electrocardiogram, blood biochemistry (liver and
kidney function, electrolytes, glucose, etc.) tests and
the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) were
conducted at baseline and at the end of 4 weeks of
treatment.

2.4 Statistical analysis
SPSS software version 13.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, 
USA) was used for analysis. Means (sd) were used to
describe test scores. Mann-Whitney tests were used for
variables with non-normal distributions. Chi-squared
tests were used to compare categorical variables
including gender and the proportion of patients in each
group whose treatment was classified as ‘effective’. For
normally distributed continuous measures, paired t-tests
were performed to compare the BEHAVE-AD total score
and each subscale score (except hallucinations), ADAS-Cog
total score and each subscale score at baseline and
after 4 weeks of treatment in each group. Two-sample
t-tests were performed for between group comparisons.
A repeated measures analysis of variance was also
conducted to compare the change in the scale scores
with treatment between the two groups after adjusting
for the baseline values. The correlation between
changes in BEHAVE-AD and ADAS-Cog was analyzed by
Spearman correlation coefficients. The significant level
was set at 0.05.

3. Results
As shown in Figure 1, one patient dropped out of each
group, so the final analysis was based on data from the
26 subjects in each group that completed the 4-week
treatment.

As shown in Table 2, there were no significant
differences at baseline between groups in the total BEHAVE-AD score or in any of the seven BEHAVE-AD
subscale scores. After 4 weeks of treatment, the total
BEHAVE-AD score decreased (i.e., improved) significantly
in both groups, but the decrease in the subscale scores
was statistically significant for only six of the subscale
scores in the intervention group and for only four of the
subscale scores in the control group. The hallucination
subscale score did not decrease significantly in either
group. After controlling for baseline values using a
repeated measures ANOVA, the improvement in the
total BEHAVE-AD score after 4 weeks of treatment was
significantly greater in the intervention group than in
the control group. The improvement was also greater in
the intervention group for five of the seven BEHAVE-AD
subscale scores: activity disturbances, diurnal rhythm
disturbances, aggressiveness, affective disturbances, 
and anxiety and fear.

Based on considering a 60% decrease from baseline
in the total BEHAVE-AD score as the cutoff for ‘effective
treatment’, 30-59% for ‘improvement’, and < 30% for
‘no improvement’, 3 patients in the intervention group
(11.5%) were effectively treated, 16 (61.5%) were
improved, and 7 (26.9%) were not improved after
treatment; in the control group 1 (3.8%) patient was
effectively treated, 10 (38.5%) were improved, and 15
(41.7%) were not improved. That is, 73.1% (19/26) of
the patients in the rTMS group showed improvement in
their behavioral and psychological symptoms compared
to only 42.3% (11/26) in the control group (X2=5.04, 
p=0.025).

As shown in Table 3, there were no significant
differences in the ADAS-Cog total scores or in any of
the four subscale scores between groups at baseline.
After 4 weeks of treatment, the ADAS-Cog total scores
dropped (i.e., improved) significantly in both groups, 
and the subscale scores dropped significantly in all
four subscales in the intervention group and in two
of the four subscales scores in the control group (the
memory and attention subscales). After controlling for
baseline values using a repeated measures ANOVA, the
improvement in the total ADAS-Cog score after 4 weeks
of treatment was significantly greater in the intervention
group than in the control group. The improvement was
also greater in the intervention group for all four ADAS-Cog
subscale scores: memory, language, constructional
praxis, and attention.

Combining results for all 52 participants who
completed the study, the correlation of the BEHAVEAD
total score and the ADAS-Cog total score was nonsignificant, 
both at baseline (rs=0.11, p=0.459) and after
treatment (rs=0.02, p=0.869). However, the magnitude
of the change in the total scores of the two scales over
the course of treatment was statistically significant (rs=
0.33, p=0.015).

During rTMS treatments, no patients experienced
seizures or epilepsy-like symptoms. There were no changes in the ECG, EEG, or blood chemistry results.
The most common adverse reactions in both groups
reported on the TESS were mild extrapyramidal
reactions (4 cases in the intervention group and 2 cases
in the control group) and transient headache (4 cases in
the intervention group and 5 cases in the control group).
These side effects were mild and well tolerated. Overall, 
30.8% (8/26) of the participants in the intervention
group experienced an adverse event during the study
while 26.9% (7/26) in the control group experienced an
adverse event (X2=0.09, p=0.760).

4. Discussion
4.1 Main findings
This study used a randomized, double-blind design
to compare the efficacy and safety of high frequency
rTMS combined with low-dose risperidone to that
of risperidone treatment alone for the treatment of
BPSD in patients with AD. We found that 4 weeks of
high frequency rTMS to the left DLPFC is an effective
adjunctive treatment method for the treatment of
BPSD in patients with AD. A much higher proportion
of patients receiving rTMS than patients receiving
sham rTMS experienced a 30% or greater drop in the
overall BEHAVE-AD score (73.1% vs. 42.3%), indicating
that the behavioral and psychological symptoms had
substantially improved.

These findings are similar to those of other
studies. Peng and colleagues[22] reported that TMS is
more effective than drug therapy for BPSD, including
sleep quality, anxiety and depression, aggression, 
and agitation. Another study in China by Wu and
colleagues[23] also reported that rTMS improved BPSD, 
but the study did not include a sham rTMS comparison
group. The efficacy of risperidone treatment alone
reported in this study was similar to that reported by
Onor and colleagues, [24] which found that low-dose
risperidone was associated with reductions in agitation, 
aggression, irritability, delusions, and sleep disorders.

We found no significant improvement in either
group in the hallucination subscale score of the
BEHAVE-AD after 4 weeks of treatment. Becker and
colleagues[25] regarded the occurrence of hallucinations
as a marker of the severity of AD psychopathology;
if true, this could explain the apparent insensitivity
of hallucinations to treatment. On the other hand, a
recent study[26] that reported the effectiveness of rTMS
as an adjunctive treatment for auditory hallucinations
used low-frequency stimulation, while our study used
high-frequency rTMS. Future studies should assess the
effectiveness of treating AD with low-frequency rTMS.

We also found that the cognitive functioning of
the high frequency rTMS group improved significantly
more than in the sham rTMS group that only received
the low-dose risperidone. This finding is similar to that
of a study by Ahmed and colleagues[15] which reported
a significant improvement in MMSE after five daily
sessions of high frequency rTMS (20Hz) over the DLPFC, 
an improvement that was maintained for three months
after the end of rTMS treatments. Other studies have
found that rTMS over the DLPFC has a good treatment
effect on cognitive impairment in both mild AD and in
moderate-to-severe AD.[27, 28] A study by Bentwich and
colleagues [29] also showed a significant effect of rTMS
(20 Hz) over the DLPFC in improving the scores of an
auditory sentence comprehension test among patients
with AD.

In this study there was no correlation between
total BEHAVE-AD and ADAS-Cog scores among the 52
AD patients who completed the study, but there was
a modest correlation (rs=0.33, p=0.015) between the
magnitude of the improvement in cognitive symptoms
(assessed by ADAS-Cog score) and the magnitude
of improvement in behavioral and psychological
symptoms (assessed by BEHAVE-AD) over the 4 weeks
of treatment. Hollingworth and colleagues[30] consider
BPSD in patients with AD a secondary cluster of
symptoms directly resulting from the primary cognitive
impairment, but Shinno and colleagues[31] consider
BPSD and cognitive impairment two separate clusters of
pathological symptoms. Our results suggest that BPSD
and cognitive impairment are different, but related, 
pathological states.

This study, which administered high-frequency rTMS
to 26 patients five days a week for four consecutive
weeks, confirms previous results about the relative
safety of this treatment. No seizures or other severe
adverse effects were observed during the 4 weeks of
treatment and there were no significant differences in
the prevalence or severity of adverse reactions between
the active and sham rTMS groups.

4.2 Limitations
There are several potential limitations to these results.
The study has a relatively small sample size so some
of the negative results, such as the failure to find
significant differences for some of the subscale scores, 
may be due to Type II errors. We only assessed the
treatment outcome at the end of the 4 weeks of rTMS
treatment sessions. Follow-up studies are needed to
determine a) how soon the treatment effect of rTMS
manifests, b) how long the treatment effect persists
after termination of the rTMS intervention, c) whether
or not the effect will be greater if the rTMS is continued
longer, d) whether or not rTMS can replace medication
in individuals who are not tolerant to medication, and
e) the appropriate interval and intensity of ‘booster
sessions’ with rTMS to sustain the positive effect.
We only used a single frequency (20Hz) and a single
location (the DLPFC) for rTMS; additional studies will
be needed to test the effect when rTMS is used at
different frequencies and applied at different locations.
Ultimately the goal will be to identify the parameters
that can be used to tailor rTMS treatments to specific
patients.

4.3 Importance
Our study found that high-frequency rTMS used as an
adjunctive treatment with low-dose risperidone can significantly improve the behavioral and psychological
symptoms of AD patients. Moreover, the combined
treatment is more effective than medication alone for
improving cognitive functioning in AD patients.

We would like to sincerely thank the patients who
participated in the study and their caregivers.
