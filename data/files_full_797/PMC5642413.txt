==== Body
INTRODUCTION
The aging population is a present reality in developing and developed countries
worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), between 2015 and 2025, the
proportion of people aged 60 years and over is set to almost double from 12% to
22%.
1
 However, a possible consequence of a high number of long-lived people is an
increased prevalence of chronic diseases such as dementia.

Approximately 46.8 million individuals were diagnosed with dementia and prevalence rates
are predicted to reach a startling 131.5 million worldwide by 2050.
2
 One of the most common types of dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD). The
International Classification of Disease, 10th revision (ICD-10), describes AD
as a neurodegenerative process
3
 characterized by progressive memory loss and other cognitive changes. According
to one investigation, AD structural brain changes (i.e. cerebral atrophy) may have
important effects on functional status, however, the prominent impact is on cognition
and behaviour.
4



Once diagnosed with AD, almost all people develop neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) at
some stage during the course of the illness.
5
 Symptoms may be observed in very early stages of the disease.
5
 Such changes include depression and apathy and are characterized by wandering,
agitation, resisting caregiver support, decreased emotional or behavioral control,
disorientation, confusion and communication skills.
6



According to a systematic review and meta-analysis of 48 investigations, apathy in AD
patients is the most prevalent symptom (49%), followed by depression (42%), aggression
(40%), anxiety (39%) and sleep disorders (39%), which explains why these are the most
addressed symptoms. Less prevalent symptoms included irritability (36%), eating
disorders (34%), aberrant motor disorders (32%), delusion (31%), disinhibition (17%),
and hallucination (16%). Euphoria was the least common, with 7% occurrence in AD
patients.
7
 The development of NPS in AD can negatively influence and accelerate disease
progression with early institutionalization, as well as interfere with treatment effects
and prognosis.
8

,

9



Another study conducted in 2010, which included 29 AD and 13 Vascular dementia (VD)
patients, showed that most AD patients presented significant NPS, such as depression and
anxiety, and that as the illness progresses there was an increased prevalence of
psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, which tend to be associated
with paranoia.
10



As stated in an annual AD report, pharmacologic treatment for dementia patients is
expensive and expected to reach $1 trillion dollars (US) worldwide in 2018, rising to $2
trillion dollars (US) by 2030.
11
 Currently, no effective pharmacologic treatment or drug has been established to
cure or reverse the deterioration caused by AD, where treatment is intended to manage
the symptoms.
12
 In fact, only a few drug treatments are useful for NPS in AD patients.
5
 In this context, non-pharmacological interventions are considered a useful
strategy due to their lower costs and almost complete absence of adverse effects in
managing behavioral symptoms and compensating for cognitive impairments. Among various
non-pharmacologic treatments, cognitive stimulation (CS) and cognitive training (CT) are
prospective options for individuals with dementia.
18
 Also, CS can be considered and may have beneficial effects on AD behavioral
symptoms in the elderly. CS promotes involvement in activities that are aimed at general
enhancement of global cognitive and social functioning, without particular
objectives.
18
 By contrast, CT usually involves guided practice of standard tasks in order to
enhance or maintain specific cognitive functions (i.e. memory). However, as stated by
the same authors, it can be very difficult to distinguish between stimulation and
training programmes.
18

,

19



Thus, all CS programs aim to optimize cognitive status within a socially-oriented
context through an integrative and inclusive approach.
4
 These programs are known to impact cognitive reserve, which is generally known
to delay global cognitive and functional expression of neurodegenerative disorderssss. Few
investigations have addressed the benefits of cognitive stimulation in neuropsychiatric
symptoms of AD.

29
 Therefore, the purpose of the present review was to provide further evidence of
the effectiveness of cognitive stimulation in neuropsychiatric symptoms among elderly
with AD. 

METHODS
The methodological process in this study was based on a systematic literature review,
guided by bibliographic searches in the following databases: Web of Science,
Scopus, PsycINFO and Medline/PUBMED. These databases were
chosen because they specifically approach topics associated with health. Boolean
operators and the keywords utilized were: (Alzheimer dementia OR Alzheimer disease OR
Alzheimer) AND (cognitive stimulation OR global stimulation OR group therapy AND
(neuropsychiatric disturbances OR neuropsychiatric disorders OR neuropsychiatric
symptoms OR depression OR agitation OR apathy OR insomnia) NOT transcranial). There were
no restrictions concerning the publication date of the papers and all included articles
were reviewed between December 2015 and June 2016. Besides the search in the databases,
we also carried out a manual search in the reference lists of the selected papers. The
following inclusion criteria were used: (1) studies involving elderly diagnosed with
Alzheimer's disease; (2) studies published in English, Spanish or Portuguese; (3)
studies that determined the effect of cognitive stimulation on neuropsychiatric symptoms
for elderly with Alzheimer's disease; (4) controlled trials. Those papers not meeting
these inclusion criteria were excluded from this review.

RESULTS SUMMARY
Search results. The literature search yielded a total of 722 papers. After initial
screening, 634 were excluded as they bore no relation with the aim of this review. The
next step was based on reading the abstracts of the remaining 88 studies, of which 62
were excluded, as they did not match any inclusion criteria. Thus, 23 studies met the
criteria for full-text review, of which 14 were subsequently eliminated because they did
not include samples diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (n=10), did not verify the effect
of cognitive stimulation on neuropsychiatric symptoms in elderly with Alzheimer's
disease (n=2), and were not controlled trials (n=2) (Figure 1). A final total of nine papers was therefore included in this
review.

Among the studies analyzed, participants were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease
according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders- IV
(DSM-IV),
21

,

22
 and by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and
Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association
(NINCDS-ADRDA).

29
 Only one study investigated for the presence of diffuse brain atrophy on
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and decreased blood flow in the parietal lobe and
posterior cingulate gyrus on single emission computed tomography (SPECT).
27



Tests used. According to the selected studies for the present review, the
neuropsychiatric symptoms addressed were apathy, depression and anxiety. The following
instruments were used to measure apathy: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI),
21

,

23

,

26

,

28

,

29
 Apathy Scale,
26
 and the Apathy Evaluation Scale.
24
 For assessing depressive symptoms, five papers used the Geriatric Depression
Scale,
23

,

24

,

26

,

27

,

29
 whereas only one study measured depression with the Minimum Data Set Depression
Rating Scale.
22
 Two studies used the Beck Depression Scale (GDS)
23

,

29
 and one applied the Cornell Scale for Depression in dementia (CSDD).
25
 Lastly, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)
25
 was used to evaluate anxiety.

Only one study used the NPI to measure sleep disturbances and eating disorders, as well
as the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) for measuring nutritional status, although no
significant differences were found.
21



With respect to the intervention period of studies, four investigations lasted for 12
weeks,
22

,

25

-

27
 followed by 24 weeks,
21

,

24
 10 weeks
28
 and lastly, 6 weeks.
23

,

29



Unfortunately, only four papers conducted follow-up assessments in order to determine
the intervention's possible long-term impact on subjects' psychological health and
functional abilities.
21

,

22

,

23

,

29
 Although one study comparing Group 1 (CS + Rivastigmine Transdermal Patch) with
Group 2 (Rivastigmine Transdermal Patch) interventions was reviewed, it was not the aim
of this review to compare these conducts.
21
 However, depressive and cognitive symptoms, as well as functional status and
risk of mortality, decreased among the elderly patients with AD when compared with
patients who received the Rivastigmine Transdermal Patch only, during the drug therapy
intervention.
21



DISCUSSION
The purpose of the present review was to verify the evidence with respect to the
benefits of cognitive stimulation in neuropsychiatric symptoms among patients diagnosed
with AD. Out of nine studies, eight revealed that CS was beneficial for patients with
mild-to-moderate AD in terms of improvement of NPS.
21

,

23

-

29
 Depression, apathy and anxiety were the neuropsychiatric symptoms most assessed. 

Eight investigations evaluated depressive symptoms, six of which revealed statistically
significant improvement in depression scores after the intervention period.
21

,

23

,

25

,

26

,

29
 This was confirmed by comparison of control and intervention groups, revealing
that the intervention group had lower scores of depression, as did their caregivers, who
also reported lower burden relative to levels assessed before the interventions,
23
 providing evidence that cognitive stimulation tends to attenuate depressive
symptoms.

A study conducted in 2016 reported little difference in depression scores on comparison
of both control and intervention groups. However, this finding may be due to the fact
that depression level may not have been sufficiently diagnosed in the elderly AD
patients to allow an accurate conclusion.
24
 The authors pointed out that the GDS assessment, used to identify depression in
the elderly, is not a specific tool for screening depression in patients with
dementia.
24
 Moreover, only one paper used a specific validated instrument for measuring
apathy
25
 and likewise, only one study used a specific instrument for measuring anxiety in
AD patients.
21
 It is important to bear in mind that these assessments should only be used as
screening tests.

Three papers assessed the effect of a CS program on apathy in patients with AD. The
first, a pilot study conducted in 2012 comprising 14 patients was undertaken to
investigate the effectiveness of cognitive stimulation, physical activity, and
socialization in AD patients' symptoms. The second, a paper published in 2011, involved
39 patients diagnosed with mild AD and to evaluated the effectiveness of an art therapy
technique in AD symptoms. The third, a 2010 study in 32 patients with mild-to-moderate
AD assigned to a CST group was carried out to determine the effects of the intervention.
All three studies reported statistically significant efficacy in lowering apathy scores
after treatment.
25

,

27

,

28



Two studies assessed anxiety. The first was performed in 2014 with 90 AD patients and
evaluated anxiety symptoms, reporting significant positive outcomes at a 6-month
follow-up.
21
 Another study in 2015 also observed significant improvement in anxiety after
cognitive stimulation.
25



Overall, significant positive outcomes for depression, apathy and anxiety were reported,
yielding strong evidence that cognitive stimulation can be effective in these NPS. Two
studies observed that AD patients that participated in physical activity, cognitive
stimulation and socialization intervention groups, had lower progression of AD symptoms
and showed an improvement in general clinical condition, as did their caregivers.
25

,

26



These symptoms may often have a gradual characteristic as the illness progresses,
therefore CS programs may play an important role in potentially attenuating or
stabilizing these symptoms in AD patients. In addition, studies have shown that CS
programs also have positive effects on healthy patients and thus may be considered an
option for those seeking to prevent the development of dementia and particularly, the
development of NPS associated with AD.
5

,

18



Moreover, a few studies showed that CS could also have benefits in mild cognitive
impairment (mild cognitive impairment  ) or in prodromal phase of the illness, reporting improvements in
patients� psychological well-being.
5

,

18

,

20
 However, it remains unclear whether the effects of a cognitive stimulation
program on less prevalent NPS in patients with AD are also positive. One possible reason
may be due to the fact that less prevalent symptoms in AD patients are less
researched.
7



Some limitations should be outlined: the investigations reviewed for the present study
had relatively small sample sizes.
21

,

22

,

26

-

28
 Two research papers pointed out the heterogeneous composition of the groups, as
a potential limitation.
22

,

24
 Another possible limitation was the lack of direct measures for evaluating some
NPS,
26
 given that direct measures are believed to provide more accurate information.
Lastly, there was significant heterogeneity in the methods used for assessing NPS and
this may have been due to the respective paper's publication year, population origin,
education level, age, study goals or settings, etc., which may have interfered in a few
results. The high variability in evaluation methods can be expected when the main topic
is health of the elderly, where the extent and complexity of assessing health problems
may have led to the need for specificity in the health assessments of the elderly.
30
 Also, as mentioned above, not all studies used evaluation methods validated for
patients diagnosed with dementia, and a more accurate and detailed evaluation method may
be necessary for better outcomes. 

The present review provides sound evidence that cognitive stimulation programs represent
an effective therapeutic alternative for mild-to-moderate AD patients, revealing
positive effects on depression, apathy and anxiety. In summary, CS programs can play an
important role in attenuating or delaying progression of symptoms of AD in elderly
patients. In addition, these programs can be associated with combined approaches based
on different modalities, such as physical activity and social and emotional support,
focusing on socialization. The effects tend to promote improvement and enhancement in
the quality of life of AD elderly patients, as well as that of their informal and formal
caregivers.
