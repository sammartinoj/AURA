associated with poor quality of life. The etiology and clinical significance of
SMCs are unclear, but these complaints are associated with objective cognitive
decline or with depression, anxiety and psychosocial stressors. Biological and
physiological brain alterations resembling those in Alzheimer's Disease have
been found in SMC. SMC can evolve with different outcomes and represent the
initial symptom or a risk factor of dementia. Active systematic search can be
useful for early screening of candidates for preventive or therapeutic
interventions.

Objective
To propose a Memory Complaints Scale (MCS) as an instrument for actively
searching for memory complaints and to investigate its utility for
discriminating demented from cognitively normal elderly.

Methods
A total of 161 patients from a teaching behavioral neurology outpatient unit
of a tertiary hospital were studied. The MCS was used in two ways, by direct
application to the patient and by application to the patient's companion.
Cognitive tests assessing depression and daily living activities were also
applied.

Results
High Cronbach's alpha coefficients were found for the two application
methods. Correlations between the two versions and the other instruments
administered for patients grouped by type and severity of dementia were also
found.

Conclusion
The MCS is a useful scale for identifying memory complaints and
discriminating demented from cognitively normal elderly. Further studies
confirming these findings are warranted.

Queixa Subjetiva de Memória (QSM) é frequente entre adultos e
idosos e está associada a pior qualidade de vida. Etiologia e significado

INTRODUCTION
The term Subjective Memory Complaint (SMC) is used generally to designate a report of
memory problems which may or may not be perceived by others, although there is
currently no consensus on a standard definition for this symptom. Subjective
Cognitive Complaint (SCC) and Subjective Memory Impairment (SMI) are other terms
used to describe the same symptom.1

SMC is a frequent symptom among adults and elderly the prevalence of which increases
with age. Population-based studies estimate prevalences as high as 46.3% in adults
50-59 years old and 63.4% in older old 80-100 years of age. Female gender and low
educational level have also been associated with higher prevalences of
SMC.2-4 Two Brazilian population samples with different
cultural and sociodemographic characteristics, one located in the Northern and the
other in the Southern region, estimated SMC prevalences at 70.0% and 56.0%,
respectively.5,6

Data in the literature vary widely regarding the etiology and clinical significance
of SMC, with studies reporting conflicting results. Studies involving population
samples have shown that SMC is associated with impaired performance on memory tests,
in elderly without dementia or depression4,7 and may predict
dementia by up to three years, particularly if associated with objective memory
deficits.8 Other studies
however, have associated SMC with psychosocial stress, anxiety or
depression.9,10

mild cognitive impairment   (mild cognitive impairment  ) includes SMC as a key diagnostic criterion.11 There is evidence suggesting that
SMC in elderly is a significant risk factor for mild cognitive impairment   12 or for dementia.13,14

Some studies have shown biological or physiological brain changes in SMC which
closely resemble those seen in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), based on structural,
functional and metabolic neuroimaging,15-18 as well as
electroencephalographic19,
magnetoencephalographic,20
genetic,21 and
neuropathologic studies.22 A
recent study has shown that hippocampal volumes correlate with outcomes of memory
training interventions in adults with mild cognitive impairment  .23

In another recent study, cognitive decline was evident in subjects from 45 years of
age and older.24 However, even
when individuals report symptoms and exhibit objective deficit, dementia may not be
diagnosed. Up to 75% of patients with moderate to severe dementia may not be
identified by the General Practitioner as having cognitive disorders while up to 97%
of patients with mild cognitive impairment   s are not identified as having incipient
dementia.25

SMCs in the elderly are associated with poorer quality of life and impaired
activities of daily living (ADL)26
and generate costs with the utilization of public primary health care
services.27

Particularly among the elderly, SMC should not be attributed to a harmless phenomenon
of senescence or a symptom or depression. The condition is polymorphic with
different outcomes and may represent an initial symptom of dementia or a risk factor
for future dementia. Therefore, SMC should be taken seriously warranting a thorough
investigation and follow-up.4,28

Active systematic search can be useful for early screening of at-risk individuals
with SMC, enabling prompt preventive or therapeutic interventions.

The aim of this study was to propose a structured questionnaire (Memory Complaints
Scale - MCS) as an instrument for actively searching for memory complaints, and to
investigate Its utility for discriminating demented from cognitively normal
elderly.

METHODS
Casuistic. The study data were collected directly from patients aged 60
years and older and also from their companions, at the Behavioral Neurology
Outpatient Unit of the Clínicas Hospital of the Ribeirão Preto School
of Medicine of the University of São Paulo (ANCP-HCFMRP) over a period
spanning 18 months. The sample comprised 161 subjects, 59.0% of female gender. Mean
age was 72.0±7.67 years and mean schooling was 4.6±3.2 years. Of the
participants, 5.0% were single, 60.2% married, 3.1% separated and 31.7% widowed.
After full clinical and laboratory assessments, 28.0% of patients were diagnosed
with AD, 26.7% mild cognitive impairment  , 16.8% vascular dementia, 26.1% other dementia types and 2.5%
with SMC.

Instruments. Memory Complaint Scale (MCS). MCS (Appendices 1 and 2) has
been used as part of the routine protocols of two teaching outpatient clinics,
previously by the ANCP-HCFMRP29
and currently by the Interdisciplinary Outpatient Unit of Neurology of the UFSCar
(ANEU-UFSCar).30 The MCS
is a scale designed for carrying out a systematic active search for memory
complaints. It comprises a questionnaire containing seven questions with graded
responses of increasing intensity (0, 1 and 2). The test subject is classified in
terms of memory complaint (MC) based on their score as follows: No MC (0-2), mild MC
(3-6), moderate MC (7-10) or severe MC (11-14). The Scale has two versions, one for
application directly to the test subject (MCS-A) and another for application to the
companion (MCS-B). Both versions contain the same items, but the first is a
self-report version while in the second the companion describes their observations
concerning the patient's memory. The instrument explores the frequency of complaints
and the degree these problems impact everyday activities, and also seeks to compare
current memory with that at a younger age and with the memory of others of similar
age. Both versions were employed in this study.

Other assessment instruments included in the cited protocols were: Mini-Mental State
Exam (MMSE);31,32 Clinical dementia Rating (CDR);33,34 Words List (immediate recall, delayed recall and
recognition) adapted from the CERAD;35 Clock Drawing Test;36 Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS);37,38 Pfeffer
Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ);39 and Frontal Assessment Battery.40,41

Procedure. This study was conducted at the ANCP-HCFMRP and approved by
the Research Ethics Committee of the HCFMRP-USP (Under CAAE 0387.0.004.000-07). This
was a correlational prospective correlational study involving a randomly selected
sample drawn from the casuistic of a specialized outpatient unit of a teaching
hospital. The data were collected on an individual basis through two visits with the
elderly and their companion, specifically assessing the clinical, cognitive and
functional status of the patient. Data were analyzed in an effort to initially check
the validity and reliability of the MCS-A and MCS-B using Cronbach's alpha, while
also investigating the item-total correlation. Subsequently, the data obtained using
the two versions of the scale were stratified into four subgroups by CDR (0, 1, 2
and 3) in order to assess the informative and discriminative power of the two MCSs
(A and B), comparing the results on the scales against the results found on the
MMSE. The data found in these four groups were submitted to Multivariate Analysis
(ANOVA) in order to identify any statistically significant differences among them.
Finally, in order to explore the informative and predictive power of the MCS
instruments, correlation studies were performed between the scores obtained using
versions A and B, and the results on cognitive tests from the protocol of the
outpatient unit, specifically on the previously mentioned tests.

RESULTS
Internal consistency of the MCS-A and MCS-B. With regard to the MCS-A
(self-report), a high Alpha coefficient (0.850) was found along with item-total
correlations greater than 0.512 on the seven items of the scale. With the regard to
the MCS-B (companion report), a similarly high Alpha coefficient (0.847) was found
and item-total correlations greater than 0.470. The coefficients found for both
scales proved reliable (above 0.080) indicating good internal consistency of the
data. Correlations of the items with total score of each scale were all greater than
0.30, indicating that all items had good informative properties for the construct
investigated, with no need or desire to remove any of the items from either scale
for adjustment purposes.

Analysis of subgroups by CDR. The sample was stratified into four
subgroups by CDR (0, 1, 2 and 3) in order to assess the informative and
discriminative potential of the MCS-A and MCS-B, comparing the results on the scales
against mean values on the MMSE for each subgroup. The results shown in Table 1, indicate that the MCS-A (self-report)
had higher memory complaint scores in milder clinical conditions (CDR 0 and 1) and
less intense scores in more advanced clinical conditions (CDR 2 and 3). Moreover,
comparison of the patient self-report (MCS-A) in the first subgroup (CDR=0) revealed
that in this category, indicating absence of dementia, the mean memory complaint
score was 7.40, higher than the mean score on the MCS-B (companion report) of 5.58.
These results appear to show that, although not recognized by the companion, a
memory problem was already perceived by the patients even in the absence of a
dementia condition.

Table 1 Subgroups by CDR.

CDR	Indicators	Mean	SD	
0 (N=43)	MCS-A	7.40	4.204	
MCS-B	5.58	5.225

MCS-B	12.09	2.859

CDR: Clinical dementia Rating; SD: standard deviation.

Results showed that, on average, patients with CDR 1 reported an MC closer to CDR 0,
whereas the reported intensity of their complaint reduced progressively at CDR 2 and
3, suggesting the occurrence of anosognosia, a common symptom in dementia
conditions. On the MCS-B however, a growing number of MCs were reported accompanying
the progression in the dementia condition. The same trend was evident for MMSE
scores in each subgroup, with decreasing scores as dementia progressed. Multivariate
analysis (ANOVA) comparing the means for the MCS-A, MCS-B and MMSE among the four
CDR subgroups (0, 1, 2 and 3), confirmed statistically significant differences
between means on the MCS-A (p≤0.05), and likewise for the MCS-B and MMSE in
each group (p≤0.01).

Significant correlations with other instruments: Studying the overall sample in
search of correlations between scores on the MCS A and B and the other assessment
instruments revealed various significant correlations, albeit of weak to reasonable
intensities. Most notable however, were the correlations between scores obtained on
the MCS-B and the Pfeffer Functional Assessment Questionnaire (0.470, p< 0.01),
and between the MCS-B and the CDR (0.509, p< 0.01) (Table 2).

Subgroups of the overall sample were also explored to identify correlations. In the
subgroup containing patients diagnosed with AD and those with cerebral vascular
disease, correlations were identified between scores on the MCS-B and on the
Pfeffer-FAQ (0.383, p< 0.01); as well as on the CDR (0.407, p< 0.01). In the
subgroup formed by only patients with AD diagnosis, correlations of 0.497 (p<
0.01) between the MCS-B and Pfeffer-FAQ; and of 0.512 (p< 0.01) between the MCS-B
and CDR, were detected.

Table 2 highlights the statistically
significant weak positive correlations between the MCS-A and performance on
cognitive tests, in addition to a positive correlation (reasonable to good) with
depression, suggesting that cognitively functional individuals seeking neurological
assistance may have MC which is possibly associated to other psychic problems.

At the same time, statistically significant inverse correlations were seen (weak to
reasonable) between MCS-B and performance on cognitive tests. These results suggest
that the higher the MC reported by the companion the lower the performance by the
patient on cognitive tests. In addition, a weak inverse correlation was also
observed between MCS-A and age, i.e. in this sample, the older individuals tended to
exhibit fewer MCs.

DISCUSSION
A number of different types of validated questionnaires are available for assessing
SMC3,6,13,42-45 but are extensive or fail to effectively discriminate SMC
from dementia.

A Memory Complaint Scale (MCS) was proposed in the present study. It was decided to
designate the scale a Memory Complaint (MC) instrument because a subjective memory
complaint, as commonly used in the literature, is redundant in the sense that all
complaints by definition refer to a subjective symptom.

The results of this study showed that the MCS is a stable, informative and
discriminate scale, for both versions A and B. These results corroborate previous
reports validating the scale.46-48

Data given in Table 1 shows that elderly
without dementia can complain of memory problems even though the companion does not
recognize them. However, patients with mild dementia reported MCs in a similar
manner to those without dementia, where the intensity of complaints reduced
progressively with advancing dementia, probably due to anosognosia, a frequent
symptom in dementia conditions.49
Conversely, reports by the companion increased progressively with advancing
dementia. The same phenomenon was observed regarding MMSE scores, with progressively
lower scores accompanying the evolution of the dementia.

In patients with AD, reports by the companion correlated with patient performance on
ADLs and severity of dementia. In preliminary results reported previously, the MCS
was considered a useful tool since although anosognosic patients self-assessed as
having no dementia, the discrepancy with the assessment by the companions is itself
discriminative. The same holds true for patients with dementia in general.46,48

The data contained in Table 2 shows the weak
positive correlations between patient-reported MCs and performance on tests of
memory and executive functions. The results also evidence a positive correlation
(reasonable to good) with the depressive symptoms questioned, suggesting that
cognitively functional individuals seeking neurological assistance may have MCs
which could be associated to depression. Other studies in outpatient casuistics have
also shown an association between MCs and depression, as well as with anxiety and
psychosocial stressors.9,10 On the other hand, MCs are common
among adults and often a source of stress and concern.50

These findings also showed negative correlations (weak to reasonable) between patient
memory problems as reported by the companion and performance on tests of memory,
executive functions and CDR, suggesting that the worse the patient's cognitive
performance, the more intense the report by the companion. The same pattern was seen
for patient performance on activities of daily living. Other studies have affirmed
that MCs are associated with performance on memory tests, even after controlling for
number of depressive symptoms.4,7 In addition, a weak negative
correlation was also observed between MCS-A and age, suggesting that in this sample
of patients from a specialized outpatient clinic, older individuals tended to
exhibit fewer MCs. However, population-based studies suggest that age is generally
associated with MCs, independently of degree of cognitive functioning.3,4

Based on these results, it can be concluded that the MCS, used in its two versions,
is a useful scale for active systematic and consistent search for memory complaints,
and may be used to discriminate demented from cognitively normal elderly. Further
studies to confirm these findings are warranted.
