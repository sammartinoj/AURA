Neuroinflammation and synaptic degeneration are major neuropathological hallmarks in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Neurogranin and YKL-40 in cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid (cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid) are newly discovered markers indicating synaptic damage and microglial activation, respectively.

Methods
cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid samples from 95 individuals including 39 patients with AD dementia (AD-D), 13 with mild cognitive impairment   (mild cognitive impairment  ) due to AD (mild cognitive impairment  -AD), 29 with mild cognitive impairment   not due to AD (mild cognitive impairment  -o) and 14 patients with non-AD dementia (non-AD-D) were analyzed for neurogranin and YKL-40.

Results
Patients with dementia or mild cognitive impairment   due to AD showed elevated levels of cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid neurogranin (p < 0.001 for AD-D and p < 0.05 for mild cognitive impairment  -AD) and YKL-40 (p < 0.05 for AD-D and p = 0.15 for mild cognitive impairment  -AD) compared to mildly cognitively impaired subjects not diagnosed with AD. cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid levels of neurogranin and YKL-40 did not differ between mild cognitive impairment   not due to AD and non-AD dementia. In AD subjects no correlation between YKL-40 and neurogranin was found. The cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid neurogranin levels correlated moderately with tau and p-tau but not with Aβ42 or the MMSE in AD samples. No relevant associations between YKL-40 and MMSE or the core AD biomarkers, Aβ42, t-tau and p-tau were found in AD subjects.

Conclusions
Neurogranin and YKL-40 are promising AD biomarkers, independent of and complementary to the established core AD biomarkers, reflecting additional pathological changes in the course of AD.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disordersss worldwide. The major pathological hallmarks of AD include extracellular depositions of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides as well as intracellular Neurofibrillary tangles consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau, loss of synapses, and neuroinflammation [1, 2]. The earliest pathophysiological events are expected to occur 10–20 years before the onset of dementia [3]. Changes in cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid (cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid) biomarkers reflecting amyloid pathology (Aβ42) and neurodegeneration [total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau)] occur early in the course of AD and are increasingly implicated in the early and predictive diagnosis of AD [4, 5]. The accuracy of diagnosis based on these core AD biomarkers is high, as long as markers of neurodegeneration and amyloidosis are altered concordantly [6]. However, in a proportion of patients, biomarker results may be contradictory, leading to lower diagnostic accuracy [7]. Additionally, Aβ42, t-tau, and p-tau allow no conclusions about cognitive performance and only a limited prediction of cognitive decline to be made, a feature that is especially important for clinical trials [8]. Therefore, additional biomarkers reflecting further aspects of AD pathophysiology, such as synaptic degeneration and neuroinflammation, are needed. Loss of synapses is an early event in the course of AD, and the correlation between synapse density and performance on neuropsychiatric tests such as the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and verbal fluency tests is well established [9–12]. Neurogranin is a postsynaptic protein expressed in the neocortex, amygdala, caudate nucleus, putamen and hippocampus in the rodent brain [13]. In the human brain, expression is highest in associative cortical areas [14], suggesting a link with cognition. It is concentrated in dendritic spines of principal excitatory synapses, and its translocation to dendritic spines is impaired in AD [15–17]. Neurogranin levels are reduced in the hippocampus and cortex in AD, indicating a loss of dendrites [2].

Synaptic proteins, including neurogranin, have been shown to be present in the cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid [18]. A first pilot study using immunoprecipitation (IP) and Western blot analysis showed a marked increase in cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid neurogranin levels in AD [19]. In a later study, using both IP-mass spectrometry and a newly developed immuno-based assay, researchers verified elevated levels of cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid neurogranin in a larger cohort of patients with AD [20, 21]. Importantly, high cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid neurogranin levels were also found in prodromal AD cases, and the degree of increase correlated with the rate of future cognitive decline [21].

Neuroinflammation is another common feature of AD pathology, and several epidemiological studies suggest a decrease in risk for AD after long-term administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [22]. YKL-40, a 39 kDa glycoprotein homologue to chitinase, is a marker for macrophage and microglial differentiation and activation [23–25]. Elevated cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid levels were shown in several infectious and noninfectious disorders of the central nervous system (central nervous system) [26]. Also, in AD, YKL-40 seems to be elevated in cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid [27–29]. The aim of this study was to investigate whether neurogranin as a marker for synaptic loss reflects cognitive disturbances and, together with YKL-40, shows aspects of AD pathophysiology complementary to amyloid pathology and neurodegeneration.

Methods
Patients and sample collection
The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the university clinic Erlangen-Nürnberg (number 3987), and all participants provided written informed consent. The patients were recruited in the memory clinic of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy in Erlangen, Germany. The participants underwent a physical, neurological, psychiatric, and neuropsychological examinations according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease test battery [30]. Clinical diagnosis was supported by a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan, hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single-photon emission computed tomography, and positive cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid biomarkers. Neurochemical dementia diagnosis was made using certified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for Aβ1-40 (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany), Aβ1-42 (The Genetics Company, Schlieren, Switzerland; and IBL International), and t-tau and p-tau (Fujirebio, Gent, Belgium; and IBL International). Diagnoses of AD and mild cognitive impairment   (mild cognitive impairment  ) were made according to the revised National Institute on Aging–Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) criteria [4, 5]. None of the patients had a history indicative of hereditary AD. Subjects with malignant diseases or signs of systemic inflammation were excluded.

Experienced physicians collected the cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid samples by lumbar puncture in the L3-L4 or L4-L5 intervertebral space. With the exception that samples were centrifuged at 1500 × g instead of 2000 × g, sampling and storage were carried out according to international consensus guidelines within 90 minutes after sampling [31].

Neurogranin assay
Measurement of neurogranin on the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD; Rockville, MD, USA) platform was performed as described previously [21]. The in-house monoclonal mouse antibody Ng7, which binds amino acids 52–65 of neurogranin, was used on a QUICKPLEX 96-well plate (MSD) as the capturing antibody. After blocking with 5 % MSD Blocker for 1 h at room temperature (RT), the full-length neurogranin calibrators in concentrations ranging from 31.3 pg/ml to 4000 pg/ml, the blanks, and 50 μl of cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid sample for each well were added in duplicates and coincubated overnight with a polyclonal anti-neurogranin antibody (ab 23570; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The next day, the plates were washed and SULFO-TAG goat anti-rabbit antibody (MSD) (25 μl/well) was added for 2 h at RT. Before the plates were read on a QUICKPLEX SQ 120 reader (MSD), 150 μl of 2× MSD read buffer with surfactant (MSD) was added to the wells. The samples were analyzed without knowledge of the clinical diagnosis. Intra-assay variation of the assay was calculated as the median of range/average from duplicate measurements, and the result was 10.4 %. Measurements of samples with a coefficient of variation (CV) above 20 % were repeated. The interassay CV was 14.2 %, as indicated by positive controls that were run on every plate. The detection ranges were 57.5–4000 pg/ml on the first plate and 69.4–4000 pg/ml on the second plate.

YKL-40 assay
YKL-40 levels were measured with a commercially available ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This assay has been validated previously for cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid [28, 29, 32, 33]. For the YKL-40 analyses, the cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid was diluted 1:100. The samples were analyzed without knowledge of the clinical diagnosis. Intraassay CVs were all below 10 %. The interassay CV, as indicated by positive controls run on every plate, was 5.6 %.

Statistical analysis
The statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Because data were skewed, group comparisons were made using the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s posttest. Correlations were determined using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn by plotting the false-positive fraction (100 % − specificity) versus the true-positive fraction (sensitivity). A p value below 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Patient characteristics
In total, 95 cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid samples collected at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Universitätsklinikum Erlangen were included in the study and categorized according to the NIA-AA criteria. The cohort consisted of 39 patients with Alzheimer’s disease dementia (AD-D) comprising patients with probable AD dementia with high evidence of AD pathophysiological process, patients with possible AD dementia with high evidence of AD pathophysiological process, and patients with probable AD dementia with intermediate evidence of AD pathophysiological process; 13 patients with mild cognitive impairment   with a high likelihood that the mild cognitive impairment   was due to Alzheimer’s disease (mild cognitive impairment  -AD); 29 patients with mild cognitive impairment   unlikely due to Alzheimer’s disease (mild cognitive impairment  -o); and 14 patients with dementia unlikely due to AD (non-AD-D) (Table 1). The group of patients with other dementia included seven patients with frontotemporal dementia, three with vascular dementia, one with Lewy body dementia, and three with dementia of unknown origin. As AD biomarkers are applied mostly in the differential diagnosis of cognitive disturbances, mild cognitive impairment  -o was chosen as the reference group. This group consisted especially of patients with depression, vascular disease, and early frontotemporal dementia (Table 1). The study population was well balanced overall according to age and sex. A significant difference in age was evident only between the non-AD-D and AD-D cohorts (p < 0.05). The core biomarkers Aβ42, t-tau, and p-tau differed highly significantly in patients with mild cognitive impairment  -AD and patients with AD compared with those in the mild cognitive impairment  -o and non-AD-D groups (p < 0.001). As expected, MMSE scores in the non-AD-D and AD-D cohorts were significantly lower than in the mild cognitive impairment   samples.Table 1 Patient characteristics

Elevated levels of neurogranin in Alzheimer’s disease
Compared with patients with mild cognitive impairment  -o, neurogranin was significantly increased in patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment  -AD (p < 0.05) and those with AD dementia (p < 0.001). No difference was found between mild cognitive impairment  -o and the non-AD-D patients (Fig. 1). The neurogranin levels in mild cognitive impairment  -AD patients did not differ from those with suspected AD dementia. No difference in neurogranin levels was found within the different AD dementia populations separated by the certainty of the diagnosis (data not shown).Fig. 1 Increased levels of cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid (cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid) neurogranin and YKL-40 in Alzheimer’s disease.

For the analysis of correlations, mild cognitive impairment  -AD and AD-D were merged into an AD group and mild cognitive impairment  -o and non-AD-D were merged into a non-AD group. Neurogranin correlated with t-tau and p-tau in the non-AD group and in the AD group (Fig. 2). However, correlations were stronger within the non-AD group (Fig. 2). A correlation between neurogranin and Aβ1-42 was found only in the non-AD group (Fig. 2). Interestingly, a strong correlation of neurogranin with Aβ1-40 was also found (Fig. 2). The MMSE score did not correlate with neurogranin levels in any of the groups (Fig. 3).Fig. 2 Neurogranin is correlated with total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and β-amyloid (Aβ40), especially in subjects without Alzheimer’s disease (non-AD). cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid levels of neurogranin in the non-AD group (a, c, e, g, and i) and patients in the AD group (b, d, f, h, and j) are plotted against YKL-40 (a, b) and core AD biomarkers (c–j). Correlations were calculated using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient

Correlations were calculated using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient



Elevated levels of YKL-40 in Alzheimer’s disease
cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid YKL-40 levels were significantly elevated in patients with AD dementia as compared with those with mild cognitive impairment  -o or non-AD dementia (p < 0.05). YKL-40 was also elevated in mild cognitive impairment  -AD patients, but without reaching statistical significance (p = 0.15). The YKL-40 levels of mild cognitive impairment  -AD and AD dementia patients did not differ (Fig. 1). The patients with other forms of dementia did not show an elevation in YKL-40 levels compared with mild cognitive impairment  -o patients (Fig. 1).

YKL-40 was age-correlated in our sample (Additional file 1: Figure S1). However, as the populations with cognitive disturbances were age-matched, no statistical correction for age was made. A significant correlation of YKL-40 with t-tau and p-tau was found only in the non-AD group (Additional file 2: Figure S2). In addition, no correlation of YKL-40 with Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, or MMSE score was observed (Fig. 3 and Additional file 2: Figure S2).

No correlation between neurogranin and YKL-40
No significant correlation could be shown between neurogranin and YKL-40, as indicators for postsynaptic integrity and microglial activation in AD (Fig. 2).

Neurogranin supports the early and differential diagnosis of AD
To test the suitability of neurogranin and YKL-40 as biomarkers for AD, ROC curves were calculated. Samples of patients with AD pathology (AD group) could be separated from those without signs of AD pathology, including other dementia (non-AD group), with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 for neurogranin and 0.66 for YKL-40 (Fig. 4). Combining the two markers by multiplication resulted in an AUC of 0.85 (Fig. 4).Fig. 4 Neurogranin distinguishes Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from non-AD subjects well.

Discussion
We have shown that the synaptic protein neurogranin and YKL-40 are elevated in the cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid of patients with AD. Even though both markers were significantly increased, they did not correlate with each other in AD.

In the diagnosis of cognitive disturbances, biochemical markers as indicators of the disease are increasingly implicated. Unfortunately, biochemical markers reflecting cognitive decline are still sparse [8]. It has long been known that the number of synapses is well correlated with the degree of cognitive disturbances [10, 34, 35]. Therefore, it is expected that biomarkers indicating synaptic integrity would be well suited to reflect cognitive decline. In our study, cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid neurogranin levels were elevated in AD. However, we found no difference in the levels of neurogranin in the dementia stage versus mild cognitive impairment  . In addition, there was no correlation between neurogranin levels and MMSE scores. Thus, our results are in line with previous reports of elevated levels of neurogranin in AD [19, 20, 36, 37]. In contrast to our present study, Thorsell et al. did not distinguish between mild cognitive impairment   due to AD and mild cognitive impairment   due to other diseases, and they measured neurogranin levels in the mild cognitive impairment   group between that of controls and that of patients with AD [19]. In their study, Kvartsberg et al. included a neuropsychological follow-up investigation which showed that high cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid levels of neurogranin at baseline predicted a more rapid decline in cognition [20]. This might indicate that neurogranin reflects not the synaptic density but rather the intensity of current synaptic destruction.

In line with previous studies, we have shown that neurogranin differentiated well between AD and other neurodegenerative disorderssss. Established core biomarkers (i.e., Aβ1–42, t-tau, and p-tau) have high diagnostic accuracy in discriminating individuals with AD from subjects without cognitive disturbances, but their diagnostic performance in differentiating AD from other dementia is far from optimal [38]. Interestingly, cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid neurogranin was not elevated in our cohort of patients with other neurodegenerative disorderssss. However, the cohort of non-AD-D patients was small and comprised especially patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Further research is necessary to clarify whether the elevation of neurogranin is specific for AD.

The stronger correlation of neurogranin and tau/p-tau in non-AD patients as compared with patients with AD and the missing elevation of neurogranin in non-AD-D patients also points to a mechanism of neurodegeneration in AD distinct from the physiological dying of neurons and distinct from other neurodegenerative disorderssss. Most likely, it shows a degeneration of synapses that is weakly related to the axonal damage indicated by tau [39]. The exact mechanism by which neurogranin is released is unclear.

Elevated levels of cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid YKL-40 in early stages of AD have been demonstrated in two independent studies, but there are also contradictory data [28, 32, 40]. In our study, we confirmed that YKL-40 is elevated early in the course of AD and that the levels do not change during disease progression. In addition, YKL-40 levels in other dementia did not differ from those with mild cognitive impairment   not due to AD. This suggests that neuroinflammation in AD pathology differs from that in other dementia. In accordance with the concept of inflammaging, introduced by Franceschi et al., we found a correlation of YKL-40 with age. Inflammaging describes a low-grade, chronic upregulation of inflammatory responses during aging as a risk factor for several age-dependent diseases [41, 42]. Accumulating evidence shows a similar alteration in the central nervous system of the elderly as a prodrome of AD [43]. In part, this increased immune reactivity in the aged brain might be derived from primed microglia. Primed microglia are in a preactivated state and tend to react in a prolonged manner and by secretion of higher amounts of proinflammatory signals [44]. Excessive inflammatory responses by primed microglia aggravate neurodegeneration, impair synaptic plasticity, and lead to cognitive decline [45]. However, we did not find a correlation between YKL-40 and MMSE. Yet, as a marker for microglial activation, YKL-40 seems well suited to reflect these aspects of AD pathophysiology.

Even though a link between microglial activation and synaptic degeneration can be postulated, we found no correlation between neurogranin and YKL-40 in our study. As detailed above, YKL-40 is a rather unspecific marker that is highly influenced by patients’ comorbidities. This might also explain why data on YKL-40 correlations are somewhat contradictory. Two studies showed a correlation with p-tau and t-tau, whereas a third did not find any correlation with cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid tau levels [27, 29, 40]. Data on correlations with MMSE are likewise conflicting [29, 40]. The missing correlation between neurogranin and YKL-40 suggests that these two markers reflect two different aspects of neurodegeneration in AD. Whereas YKL-40 might represent Aβ-mediated activation of microglia and neuroinflammation, elevated levels of neurogranin might indicate synaptic damage of another origin, such as direct Aβ-mediated neurotoxicity via soluble oligomers, disturbances in calcium homeostasis, or mitochondrial damage [46–52].

To evaluate neurogranin and YKL-40 as potential biomarkers for AD, we determined ROC curves for both markers alone and a combination of both markers by multiplication. With an AUC of 0.85, the diagnostic performance of neurogranin is in the reported range of the isolated core biomarkers. The combination of Aβ, tau, and neurogranin might therefore improve diagnostic performance considerably. A comparison with core biomarkers was not possible in our study, as patients were selected according to these markers. To further evaluate the potential of neurogranin as a diagnostic biomarker, further studies including patients not stratified by established biomarkers are needed. The additional benefit of YKL-40 as biomarker for AD is limited, with an AUC of 0.66, and is a rather unspecific marker. However, YKL-40 might be useful for patient stratification and monitoring of drugs targeting microglial activation.

Conclusions
Taken together, elevated levels of neurogranin and YKL-40 could be found in cerebral cerebral cerebral cerebral spinal fluid samples of patients with AD compared with those with other dementia and control subjects. The expected relationship between postsynaptic damage and microglial activation in AD could not be shown using these markers. Therefore, neurogranin and YKL-40 might support the biochemical dementia diagnosis by reflecting aspects of AD pathophysiology complementary to Aβ and tau.
