Anualmente, 500 mil pessoas são hospitalizadas com lesão cerebral
adquirida após traumatismo crânio-encefálico (TCE) no
Brasil. Setenta e cinco a cem mil pessoas morrem poucas horas após o
evento e 70 a 90 mil evoluem para perda irreversível de alguma
função neurológica. Entre as principais causas de TCE
estão os acidentes automobilísticos (50%), quedas (21%), assaltos

foram revisados os conceitos básicos relacionados ao TCE, tais como os
mecanismos de lesão, os níveis graves de TCE, os achados mais
comuns em sobreviventes de TCE moderado e grave e as deficiências
cognitivas mais comuns após TCE e discutidas as estratégias
utilizadas para lidar com pacientes pós-TCE. Como resultado, nosso estudo
irá fornecer informações relevantes relacionadas com um
serviço de reabilitação cognitiva estruturada e,
certamente, irá oferecer uma alternativa para pacientes e famílias

TBItraumatic brain injurycognitive rehabilitation
==== Body
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a nondegenerative, noncongenital insult to the brain from
an external mechanical force, possibly leading to permanent or temporary impairment of
cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functions, with an associated diminished or
altered state of consciousness.1 The
definition of TBI has not been consistent and tends to vary according to specialties and
circumstances. The term brain injury is often used synonymously with head injury, which
may not be associated with neurologic deficits. The definition has also been problematic
due to variations in inclusion criteria.2

Both American and Brazilian data indicate that about 500,000 people suffer TBI annually,
with 20% afflicted with moderate or severe TBI. According to this data, 80% of people
who suffered mild TBI can return to work, whilst only 20% of moderate, and 10% of
victims of severe, TBI patients can return to their daily routine.3,4

In this context, cognitive rehabilitation, a clinical area encompassing interdisciplinary
action aimed at recovery as well as compensation of cognitive functions altered as a
result of cerebral injury, is extremely important for these individuals.5 The aim of a cognitive rehabilitation
program is to recover an individual’s ability to process, interpret and respond
appropriately to environmental inputs, as well as to create strategies and procedures to
compensate for lost functions that are necessary in familial, social, educational and
occupational relationships.2 In
general, the cognitive rehabilitation programs tend to focus on specific cognitive
domains, such as memory, motricity, language and executive functions. By contrast, the
focus of compensatory training procedures is generally on making environmental
adaptations and changes to provide greater autonomy for patients. Successful cognitive
rehabilitation programs are those whose aim is both recovery and compensation based on
an integrated and interdisciplinary approach.6

The purpose of this study was to review the basic concepts related to TBI, including
mechanisms of injury, severity levels of TBI, the most common findings in moderate and
severe TBI survivors, and the most frequent cognitive impairments following TBI, and
also to discuss the strategies used to handle patients post-TBI. Within this context,
the importance of an interdisciplinary rehabilitation for TBI is underlined. According
to the above topics, a strategic search of the studies held on the main data bases was
carried out. The computer-based search covered the following databases: Pubmed/Medline,
ISI Web of Knowledge, Cochrane data base and Scielo. The search terms, physical therapy,
occupational therapy, psychology, phonoaudiology, recovery, rehabilitation, traumatic
brain injury, brain injury and TBI in combination with cognitive rehabilitation, were
employed. Papers and book chapters published in Portuguese, Spanish and English,
conducted from 2001 to 2010 were preferentially reviewed.

Mechanism of injury
The mechanisms and consequences that lead to brain injury vary depending on the type
of trauma. Injury occurs when the skull is struck by an object or collides against a
hard surface resulting in kinetic energy transfer from the object to the head that
can cause fractures or lesions in the brain tissue. Motor vehicle accidents and
falls from high places often cause such fractures or lesions. Another mechanism
constitutes the sudden arrest of head movement, leading to
acceleration-deceleration, while the brain remains in its original inertial motion
and is suddenly driven off in the opposite direction. In this mechanism the areas of
lesion or friction may damage brain tissue that collides against the bone structure.
Cortical contusions may also occur as a consequence of tissue abrasion and may
result in focal bleeding and edema. An event commonly occurring in car accidents is
head trauma caused by collision against the windshield, followed by a rapid backward
movement of the head which can cause injury in posterior areas. Such lesions are
called coup and contrecoup. Lesions can also occur in the lower portion of the brain
surface by traumatic contact against the irregular surface of the skull base, during
the acceleration and deceleration movement inside the skull. Orbital and lateral
basal portions of the front and temporal lobes are especially vulnerable to this
type of lesion.7

Another cause of focal lesion occurs with the rupture of small meningeal vessels (due
to direct impact leading to skull fracture and extradural hematomas) or brain
surface, through the acceleration-deceleration mechanism leading to subdural
hematomas. The mechanism and the intensity of the impact of head trauma and the
cerebral edema generated by it can cause intraparenchymal hemorrhage and/or edema
and lead to infarct areas caused by reduction or discontinuation of cerebral
perfusion.7

The acceleration-deceleration mechanism can cause neural lesions, and diffuse axonal
injury (DAI). The long fiber tracts are more vulnerable to this type of injury.
Depending on the location and extent of DAI, extensive brain areas may be affected
and could trigger a cascade of damaging processes including failures in axonal
transport and diffuse injury, with functional discontinuity of the axon. This
process typically occurs in the initial 24 hours following trauma, but may extend
further, depending on its severity. The areas most commonly affected by DAI are the
medial frontal lobes, the corpus callosum and the superior cerebellar
peduncles.7

In addition to trauma, other mechanisms may be linked to the sequelae that affect
patients, such as surgical manipulation, disruption of the blood-brain barrier with
late hemorrhage, and in cases of multiple trauma, shock, cardiac and/or respiratory
arrest and anoxia, seizures and post-traumatic hydrocephalus, during clinical
evolution.7

Severity levels of TBI
The conscience level and/or coma in the first 24 hours, along with the duration of
Post Traumatic Amnesia (PTA), after TBI are the most used references to distinguish
TBIs as mild, moderate or severe injuries. The most widely used method to classify
TBIs is a scoring system called the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), which assesses the
ability of eye opening, motor and verbal responses as determiners for evaluation.
GCS scores range from 3 to 15, where a score less than or equal to 8 indicates
severe injury, from 9 to 12 moderate injury, and 13 to 15 mild injury.8

Post Traumatic Amnesia denotes the period spanning from coma and up until the moment
the patient recovers memory consistently. This period can be associated with a
transient state of disorientation, agitation and behavioral disturbances such as
insomnia, agitation, confabulation and, occasionally, serious affective and
psychotic symptoms.9

One of the most-used scales to evaluate Post Traumatic Amnesia is the GALVESTON
Orientation and Amnesia Test. Typically, in post-TBI patients, personal orientation
recovers before spatial orientation or the perception of what took place. Temporal
orientation is the last to recover.

TBI severity is first rated using the Glasgow scale, coma and Post Traumatic Amnesia
period. A TBI is considered severe when the GCS is from 3 to 8, the period of coma
is longer than 6 hours and the PTA period is longer than 24 hours. Moderate TBI has
a GCS from 9 to 12, coma period of less than 6 hours, and PTA of between 1 and 24
hours. Finally, mild TBI has a GCS of 13 to 15, coma lasting 20 minutes or less, and
PTA less than or equal to 1 hour.

Despite the support of the scales, the residual consequences post-TBI tend to occur
differently in each patient. However, the majority of those who suffer mild traumas
have a recovery process without major complications, and are able to return to their
pre-trauma activities. By contrast, the majority of patients who suffer moderate and
severe TBI present sequelae and limitations. Nevertheless, a number of mild trauma
patients have post-trauma repercussions that require special care and attention from
specialized professionals.

Most common findings in moderate and severe TBI survivors – This group
of patients is characterized by diffuse axonal injury and secondary complication at
the site or sites of injury. These patients present loss of consciousness and/or
alertness. At this stage, the first approaches are medical, surgical, and/or
pharmacological. Other supportive care, physical and respiratory therapy are also
considered at this point of intervention.7 In addition, speech therapy activities for sensory
stimulation are recommended to promote neural plasticity and minimize environmental
deprivation.10

About 2-15% of patients remain in this state, also known as a vegetative state, for 1
year or more.11 Most moderate to
severe TBI patients gradually regain stimuli responsiveness (movement, speech)
despite persistent erratic and disorganized behavior. The first signs of response
are often to vocal and auditory stimuli automatically, which may gradually come
under some volitional control. Even without verbal manifestation, the next step may
involve motor response to verbal commands. Patients are often agitated during this
period. These individuals’ evolution is accompanied by confusion, disorientation,
significant attention deficit, disinhibition and impairment of memory (includes
PTA). The patient’s comprehension, memory and learning remain impaired regardless of
regaining speech.

The next stage experienced by these individuals, usually during post-hospital care or
while undergoing outpatient monitoring, is characterized by the recovery of
orientation and old memories together with difficulty in acquiring new learning and
retaining new memory beyond the PTA. The duration and intensity of these cognitive
impairments are directly associated with the intensity of the TBI. The intervention
in terms of rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation is at a stage where more
intensive efforts are made. Acquisition of basic sensory-motor integration (posture
control, head and trunk control, gait acquisition and swallowing), training and
recovery or stabilization of Basic Activities of Daily Living (ADL) such as dressing
and undressing, personal hygiene and eating, among others, are emphasized in an
initial approach. The reestablishment of basic cognitive skills (orientation,
attention, memory, receptive and expressive communication) and other motor
rehabilitation and ambulatory actions are also pursued. The cognitive stimulation
from the interdisciplinary team (various professionals attending the patient in a
holistic manner to enhance operations) at this stage is fundamental because the
patient is only able to embark on motor training if a minimum attentional state can
be maintained which allows the patient to execute and repeat the tasks
proposed.7

In cases of motor damage, motor rehabilitation and physical therapy clearly play a
vital role in the patient’s stabilization and/or recovery. From a cognitive
perspective, at this stage temporo-spatial orientation and attention call for
redoubled efforts to maximize the communication with the patient so as to improve
strategies that use motor and cognitive training. In terms of speech, intervention
should promote the structuring of activity, with a highly predictable
distraction-free environment and also activities that induce self-monitoring.

The biggest hurdle at this stage stems from the fact that most patients have
significant attentional deficit that limits the role of comprehensive
rehabilitation.

After the most critical phase of hospital management, most patients return home.
Although some patients manage to regain some degree of independence in their
self-care, they are still incapable of applying critical thinking to decision-making
processes, providing for the needs of their families, or continuing work, school or
social activities, which can cause difficulties in family relationships and result
in a poor quality of life for patients and their relatives. Moreover, patients may
manifest mood alteration and depression.

The rehabilitation of these patients after hospital discharge is aimed at a community
integration program with day center resources that provide continuity of patient
care with vocational and professional training integrated into the rehabilitation
process.10

The Rancho Los Amigos levels of cognitive functioning scale is a widely used scale
that systematically standardizes the functional level of post-TBI patients in order
to establish the possibility of their rehabilitation management.12 Another scale of diffuse axonal
injury rehabilitation stages developed by Tuel13 and modified by Katz14 is also useful at this stage.

Most common cognitive impairments following TBI – The type and degree of
the cognitive impairment following TBI can vary widely, depending on the severity
and site of injury. If a focal brain injury occurs, the consequence may be similar
to an injury caused by a CVA, such as aphasia, apraxia, unilateral neglect or
visuospatial dysfunction. However, these are the typical findings following TBI. Due
to the mechanisms of acceleration- deceleration that often damage the ventral and
lateral regions of the frontal and temporal lobes, the most commonly found sequelae
are attention and memory deficit, difficulty in learning new information, resolving
problems, planning, as well as problems associated with impulsivity and
self-control. Some “subclinical” findings such as change in naming, verbal fluency
and auditory discrimination are also reported.

Initially, attention deficits are the most common and severe in the residual stage,
usually involving difficulty in maintaining divided attention.

The long-term memory is generally restored, but some individuals continue having
difficulties in learning new things and in retaining new information. Working memory
is frequently affected including the stages of encoding, storage and retrieval of
information. Such changes cause a significant impact on social and vocational
reintegration.15,16

Many individuals present with amnesic syndrome, more common in those who have gone
through periods of hypoxia and anoxia.

Executive functions may also be affected, and are related to frontal lobe damage. In
cases of severe frontal injury the patient may be inert, or present no initiative
(medial or lateral frontal injury), or exhibit inappropriate behavior and
impulsiveness. Many individuals with frontal lobe injury in post-TBI retain many of
their skills but are unable to initiate, sequence, organize or monitor their actions
so as to meet the targets or goals set.

The most commonly observed language disorders occur in the discursive (tendency to
produce irrelevant information and omission of key information), pragmatic (loss in
production of inferences, difficulty in formulating arguments) and conversation
levels (loss of initiative and maintenance of topics with changes in an inconsistent
manner and without signaling). These changes correlate with cognitive impairments in
attention, memory and slow mental processing.10

The inability to curb impulsive reactions leads to social and family relationship
problems. Patients often have poor self-criticism regarding their condition and
behavioral changes.

Strategies to manage post-TBI Patients
Cognitive function evaluation – Patients will initially be subjected to
a reading test, which consists of reading simple children’s books to evaluate how
long they focus on the book. According to the performance and education of each
individual, slightly more complex texts will be presented.

After this first test, each patient will be classified according to the Rancho Los
Amigos scale and only those who score greater than or equal to 5 (on the scale of 8)
will be referred for cognitive rehabilitation.15

This is necessary because to be rehabilitated the individual must maintain a minimum
time set for the task of greater than 10 minutes.

The next intervention will be to conduct a neuropsychological evaluation, speech and
occupational therapy including the Mini Mental State Examination17,18 and clock drawing. The neuropsychological assessment
includes the evaluation of affective/emotional state,19-21
functional activity questionnaire,22 batteries of tests of executive functions (Wisconsin sorting
card test,23 Stroop interference
test,24,25) as well as other tests including the Rey
auditory-verbal learning test,26
WAIS III attenttion, digit-symbol and visuo-construtive tests,27 trail making test parts A and
B,28 verbal fluency
tests,29 and Rey complex
figure.30 All tests have
been previously validated in Brazil with scores for different levels of
schooling.

The speech evaluation includes pragmatic assessment, according to precepts of
conversational analysis, test of verbal working memory for auditory input (N-Back)
language evaluation (Arizona Battery for Communication Disorders - ABCD).31

The tests used have been previously validated in Brazil with scores for different
levels of schooling except for the “Test of Practical Judgment” (TOP-J), which has
no version in Portuguese and the Arizona Battery for Communication Disorders - ABCD,
which is undergoing a validation process, and is to be included in our battery.
Computerized tests that evaluate response time to a particular task will also be
conducted.

Occupational therapy evaluates cognition in order to determine the individual’s
capacity to live alone safely and comfortably, and to work or undertake any activity
they deem important or meaningful.32 Also, the therapy limits the impact of deficits in memory,
attention and executive functions in performing activities of daily living. The
evaluation of performance in BADL and IADL requires the observation of the
individual’s behavior in the context in which they conduct these activities. The
information obtained is later used to develop strategies together with the
individual and their family which will help minimize the impact of each cognitive
loss.

Through the evaluation of cognitive abilities on tasks it is possible to determine
the patient’s strengths, limitations and challenges in learning abilities and
environmental strategies that will support their daily life.33,34 Assessment in Occupational Therapy includes
LOTCA.35,36

After the neuropsychological, speech and occupational therapy evaluation, individual
rehabilitation strategies are developed in conjunction with the interdisciplinary
team.

Tools used in cognitive rehabilitation
Part of the training/rehabilitation will be performed at CEREDIC outpatient units
(Reference Center for Cognitive Disturbances - HC/FMUSP) and part by caregivers
trained by our team, at the patient’s home. The participant caregivers are given a
handout with instructions and the training proposed.

The proposed exercises will be based on the neuropsychological test results, focusing
on the most affected attentional subtypes. The behavioral approach entails guidance
on caregiver assistance in ADL.

Attention – The treatment is usually based on patient engagement in
performing repetitive exercises including selective, sustained, alternating and
divided attention.

Sustained attention training

Listen to a word sequence and identify when you see a word stimulus,
which was previously presented.

Understanding of spoken text of a paragraph (originally short and
simple), that has progressively increasing difficulty throughout the
course of training.

Sequencing of numbers in ascending order and / or decreasing
verbally.

Math Activities - mentally.




Alternating attention training
Exercise in which the patient must identify a previously defined word and
word sequence , identifying when it appears in a text or string of words
they will listen to, replacing the 1st word, when identified,
with the previously given sequence.

Tasks with pen and paper, where the patient has to write a number and a
letter that complete a sequence written with gaps to be filled.

Activities that start with a number, which must be sequentially added or
subtracted by the other items that are being presented.

Selective attention training

Any test which has been reported for sustained attention, with a
distractor sound or motion associated.

Tasks with visual distractors - such as tasks involving drawing with
paper and pen (pencil) on a sheet full of tracings and background
designs.




Divided attention training

The patient reads a few paragraphs paying attention to their content
while the patient looks up the proposed word in advance.

The patient completes a test battery of sustained attention training,
in which the patient has to respond to verbal or parallel visual
stimuli (which can be accomplished by including computerized
tests).




Memory
Attention – Discussed in the previous topic.

Deciphering the meaning of stimuli – In order to rehabilitate memory,
the first aspect is to verify whether the patient maintains sufficient attention on
the stimulus or task given (as seen in the previous topic). The second aspect is to
assess whether the patient is able to “decipher” the stimulus given, if the patient
knows the word or object (verbal or visual stimulus) or can categorize them (words
or objects) into any semantic grouping.

The drill used for this type of injury consists of repetition of words. Concurrently,
it involves categorization of words such as by asking if a cat is an animal seen at
the zoo or by eliciting the rhyme of a given word.

Naturally, a team of speech therapists will evaluate losses involving comprehension
and language.

Memory storage – This involves learning new tasks or old skills that
were lost. When there are bilateral hippocampal lesions, the retention mechanism of
long-term learning memory is lost. Processes of verbal repetition and writing are
important for this training.

Evocation - of old memories – This entails training with pictures or
words that are subsequently presented and evoked several times. Repetition, writing,
drawing and verbal processes are important in this training. Individuals sustaining
frontal lobe injury can remember facts, but not associate them with a context or
time of occurrence. Generally, they confabulate based on a pre-existing fact.

In order to rekindle the old memory, a strategy is to repeat the known facts which
the patient is unable to remember, using pictures, or by repeating stories until
they are remembered. This differs from the bi-hippocampal lesion which preserves old
memories (except the period of post-traumatic amnesia) but renders the individual
incapable of retaining new learning.

Training strategies outside the outpatient unit
Initially, the patient undergoes neurological, neuropsychological, speech and
occupational therapy evaluation. Once the evaluation is finished, the
interdisciplinary team defines the treatment strategy.

Roadmaps will then be developed in each case. The sequence below lists possible
training strategies to be developed concurrently with the behavioral training at
home.


Remember events during the current day (at the end of the day) or for the
previous day (in the morning).

After recalling the events, write them in a notebook whenever
possible.

Receive new information - summaries of news about some event or family,
read a short informational text.

Plan the morning’s, day’s or week’s (Whenever possible) activity.

Talk about past events that have been forgotten or are not well
contextualized after the accident.

Follow the primer of daily activities with attention, executive
functions, language and memory activities as well as activities of daily
living.

Medication approach when appropriate. AChe inhibitors, antidepressants,
Ritalin, among others.




The Behavioral Training method is based on the ABA - Applied Behavior Analysis
method, based on behaviorism which involves observation, analysis and explanation of
the association among environment, human behavior and learning.37 Once the behavior is analyzed, an
action plan can be implemented to change this behavior. The action plan is based on
Operant Conditioning, a term coined by Skinner, which defines a behavior followed by
a reinforcing stimulus which results in an increased likelihood of that behavior
occurring in the future.38

In conclusion, our study yielded relevant information related to a structured
cognitive rehabilitation service and represents an alternative for patients and
families afflicted by TBI, enabling the generation of multiple research
protocols.
