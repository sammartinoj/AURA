applied to patients diagnosed with Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) and its
variants: Semantic (SPPA), Nonfluent (NFPPA) and Logopenic (LPPA) to establish
evidence-based recommendations for the clinical practice of cognitive
rehabilitation for these patients.

METHODS
A PubMed and LILACS literature search with no time restriction was conducted
with the keywords PPA (and its variants) AND
rehabilitation OR training OR
intervention OR therapy OR
treatment OR effectiveness. To develop
its evidence-based recommendations, a research committee identified
questions to be addressed and determined the level of evidence for each
study according to published criteria (Cicerone et al., 2000). Overall
evidence for treatments was summarized and recommendations were derived.

RESULTS
Our search retrieved articles published from 1995 to 2013: 21 for SPPA, 8 for
NFPPA, 3 for LPPA and 8 for PPA with no specification. Thirty-five studies
were rated as Class III, consisting of studies with results obtained from
one or more single-cases and that used appropriate single-subject methods
with adequate quantification and analysis of results. The level of evidence
of three functional interventions could not be established. One study was
rated as Class II and consisted of a nonrandomized case-control
investigation.

CONCLUSION
Positive results were reported in all reviewed studies. However, in order to
be recommended, some investigation regarding the intervention efficacy was
required. Results of the present review allows for recommendation of some
nonpharmacological interventions for cognitive deficits following PPA as
Practice Options. Suggestions for further studies on PPA interventions and
future research are discussed.

INTRODUCTION
The term Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) was first used by Mesulam1,2 in order to designate a progressive and circumscribed language
disorder (aphasia) with relative preservation of functioning in activities of daily
living and in the absence of deficits on other cognitive domains in the first two
years post-symptoms onset. Cases of PPA were generally categorized as Nonfluent
Progressive Aphasia or Semantic Dementia according to the consensus of Neary et
al.3 or as fluent and
nonfluent progressive aphasia2 in
many studies conducted since then. A third syndrome, logopenic aphasia was reported
in 2004.4 The past three decades have seen a clear advance in the characterization
of these syndromes with detailed descriptions of prominent speech and language
deficits, regions of brain atrophy/ hypometabolism and also specification of the
underlying pathology in many cases. In 2011, an international group of PPA
investigators agreed on diagnostic criteria for PPA and on clinical,
imaging-supported and definite pathology criteria for the diagnosis of three
distinct variants: non-fluent/agrammatic (NFPPA), semantic (SPPA) and logopenic
(LPPA).5

In a considerable number of patients with PPA the onset of the disease occurs at a
young age and has a devastating effect on their functional status and quality of
life. The extensive progress in PPA diagnosis has led to a growing number of
patients in need of treatment alternatives. In the absence of clearly effective
pharmacological options,6 there has
been increasing interest in other approaches, particularly behavioral interventions.
Croot et al. (2009) performed a broad literature review on clinical management in
PPA whose main objective was to assist clinicians to make choices about speech
pathology service provision. The authors reviewed 25 studies and made important
considerations about intervention features and their results as well as suggestions
for future research in this area. However, to our knowledge, no systematic review on
nonpharmacological interventions has been conducted thus far. In addition, several
studies have emerged since 2009 including biomarkers and more rigorous experimental
control to measure treatment effects. Therefore, our objective was to conduct a
systematic review on nonpharmacological interventions applied to patients diagnosed
with PPA syndromes aimed at establishing evidence-based recommendations for the
clinical practice of cognitive rehabilitation for patients with PPA. Specifically,
we considered the evidence-based practice guidelines provided by the ASHA7 and the evidence classification
criteria for cognitive rehabilitation established by Cicerone et al.8.

According to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health
(ICF)9 the term disability
covers impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions.
Nonpharmacological interventions can focus on any of these levels. In the present
paper, we classify treatments into impairment-directed and functional interventions.
The former target remediation or focus on slowing the progression of specific speech
and language impairments, such as naming deficits, dysgraphia, agrammatism and
apraxia of speech, whereas the latter focus on functional communication including
environmental modifications, compensatory strategies or increasing levels of
participation in communication activities.

In 1995, McNeil et al.10 published
a study combining pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment for a patient
with PPA. They found equivalent results for the pharmacological plus behavioral
treatment compared to the provision of behavioral treatment alone. Almost 20 years
on, cognitive rehabilitation in PPA is still considered a "new" area in
Neuropsychology and Speech and Language Therapy with many unanswered questions.
There is no consensus on recommendation criteria of different types of
interventions, intensity, duration and periodicity of treatments. In addition,
therapy gains concerning both evolution of cognitive symptoms, functioning in
activities of daily living and quality of life of patients, their carers and family
still need further investigation.

It is crucial to analyze critically the accumulated knowledge in this area to provide
guidelines for future research that may increase the level of evidence about these
interventions and support treatment choices in a clinical context. Moreover, we
intend this paper to provide a summary and an update of recent findings for
therapists practicing this area.

METHOD
In order to carry out a systematic review that would encompass international as well
as Latin-American studies, two indexing databases were consulted: PubMed, from the
National Library of Medicine of the United States of America, and LILACS, the Latin
American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database. The terms entered in
both databases were the following: [1] "Primary Progressive Aphasia AND
(rehabilitation OR training OR intervention OR therapy OR treatment OR
effectiveness)", [2] "Semantic Dementia AND (rehabilitation OR training OR
intervention OR therapy OR treatment OR effectiveness)", [3] "Nonfluent Progressive
Aphasia AND (rehabilitation OR training OR intervention OR therapy OR treatment OR
effectiveness)", [4] "Logopenic aphasia AND (rehabilitation OR training OR
intervention OR therapy OR treatment OR effectiveness)". The retrieved titles were
submitted to the following exclusion criteria: Titles that were clearly not about
PPA, papers that were not written in English, French, Portuguese or Spanish were all
excluded. Subsequently, abstracts of the selected titles were read, and the
following exclusion criteria were applied: review studies were excluded, except for
those that mentioned treatments and interventions for Frontotemporal Lobar
Degeneration syndromes. All papers that made no mention of any type of
non-pharmacological treatment were also excluded. Case studies were kept for further
analysis, since they may mention a nonpharmacological treatment undertaken by the
patient in the body of the text. After abstract selection, their respective articles
were read. References of selected papers were also scanned in order to identify
other related papers that were not indexed in the searched databases but would also
contribute to this review. The same exclusion criteria mentioned before were applied
to the titles found in the references of the selected papers. Only complete
manuscripts published in indexed journals were included, therefore interventions
published as book chapters and conference abstracts were not analyzed.

This selection procedure was performed by three of the authors of this study, so as
to ensure an acceptable degree of agreement. To develop its evidence-based
recommendations, a research committee identified questions to be addressed and
determined the level of evidence for each study according to published criteria for
cognitive rehabilitation.8 After
reading the papers, the authors agreed on the following variables to be observed and
used as classifying criteria in the studies: diagnosis, duration of the disease at
intervention, age at intervention, sex, educational level, study design,
intervention type, intervention features (goals, procedures, language spoken,
individual/group sessions, intervention length, frequency and duration of sessions,
home-practice, involvement of a caregiver, materials), outcome measures, results,
maintenance of gains, generalization, follow-up and comparison of measures of brain
activity pre and post-treatment. Overall evidence for treatments for each PPA
subtype was summarized and recommendations were derived from consideration of the
strengths of evidence. The main features of the studies are summarized in the tables
presented in the results section of this paper.

RESULTS
Searches on PubMed and LILACS databases retrieved 814 and three titles, respectively.
More specifically, combined with "(rehabilitation OR training OR intervention OR
therapy OR treatment OR effectiveness)", the term "Semantic dementia" retrieved 537
titles, "Non-fluent progressive aphasia", 133, "Primary progressive aphasia" 124,
and "Logopenic aphasia", 20 titles on PubMed. The three titles found on LILACS were
all retrieved with the term "Primary progressive aphasia", whereas all other
combinations retrieved no titles. Many of the search results overlapped, and after
applying the exclusion criteria, only one article from LILACS remained, whereas 19
articles from PubMed were selected. Scanning the references from these selected
papers, and also references from case studies and review articles previously found
on PubMed and LILACS, retrieved another 19 papers, which were added to the final
list in order to be analyzed. In summary, this paper analyzed a total of 39 articles
related to interventions on PPA. The search took place on November of 2012 and was
repeated in January 2013. The complete list of selected papers is found in Tables 1-4. Detailed information including study design, description of
interventions, pre and post-assessment tools, and results is provided in

Interventions were grouped first by diagnosis and then intervention type
(impairment-directed vs. functional, similarly to Croot et al.9). Thus, Table 1 summarizes findings for SPPA, with 21
papers revised (19 impairment-directed and two functional interventions). Table 2, NFPPA, lists eight papers, five
impairment-directed and three functional interventions. Table 3, LPPA, contains three manuscripts reporting
impairment-directed interventions. And finally, Table 4 is for PPA, including studies that have not been classified into
PPA subtypes or studies that analyzed groups of PPA patients with no concern for
specific variants or that included patients that do not conform to the prototypes
defined in the international consensus. Eight papers were included in Table 4, five impairment-directed interventions
and three functional interventions.

Papers regarding SPPA interventions (Table 1)
were published between 1999 and 2012, most of them were case reports of a maximum of
four patients. The mean age of patients described in treatments was 62.48 years old
(SD=8.50, range 53-87) at intervention baseline, 52% were men, and patients reported
an average disease duration of 3.6 years (SD=1.55). In general, therapies varied
from one single session to 18 months for impairment-directed therapies, and from
five to 48 months for the functional interventions. Six interventions were
exclusively based on home practice, where therapies at home varied from three to 10
weeks. From 2009 onwards, strategies that included pictures began to include not
only presentation on paper cards, but also on the computer screen. Except for two,
all interventions included follow-up that ranged from two weeks to two years. Only
one study addressed post-intervention changes in brain activity23 and similarly only one calculated
effect sizes for therapy results.29 Twenty studies were rated as Class III, consisting of results
obtained from one or more single-cases and that used appropriate single-subject
methods with adequate quantification and analysis of results. The level of evidence
of the functional intervention carried out by Wong et al.30 could not be established due to absence of
reliable methodological control to determine treatment effects.

NFPPA papers (Table 2) were published between
1996 and 2013 and described patients whose mean age was 66.45 years old (SD=6.96,
ranging from 58 to 77 years). 72% of the cases were women, varying from one to three
patients. On average, impairment-directed interventions had around 22 sessions
(SD=20.57), ranging from 8 to 60 training sessions. When home-practice sessions were
not taken into account for calculation, the average number of sessions was 10.6
(SD=3.43). Only three studies reported follow-up testing, which ranged from one to
12 months. One study reported fMRI investigation supporting therapy
results.35 Functional
interventions presented longer durations, from 9 weeks to 4 years of therapy. Seven
studies were rated as Class III, consisting of results obtained from one or more
single-cases and that used appropriate single-subject methods with adequate
quantification and analysis of results. The level of evidence of the functional
intervention carried out by Rogers & Alarcon38 could not be established due to absence of reliable
methodological control to determine treatment effects.

Regarding LPPA interventions (Table 3), papers
were published between 2009 and 2013 and the reported cases presented a mean age of
68 years old (SD=7.93). Therapy duration ranged from two to 11 weeks and home
practice and was emphasized in only one study40 which was also the only study that included follow-up
testing (six months after intervention). Two interventions aimed to treat naming and
lexical retrieval deficits and one targeted spelling deficits. Only one study
reported use of cerebral imaging data (fMRI) as a post-treatment measure.40 The three studies were rated as
Class III, consisting of results obtained from one or more single-cases and that
used appropriate single-subject methods with adequate quantification and analysis of
results.

The PPA table (Table 4) summarized eight
papers published from 1995 to 2013, including a total of 21 cases whose mean age was
60.88 years old (SD=3.88, ranging from 55 to 68 years). Patients' clinical features
varied in these studies, as did intervention goals. One of these studies employed
high-frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.42 Half of the studies entailed
follow-up testing, which ranged from one month up to 3 years. One study reported the
effect size of the intervention.43
Six studies were rated as Class III, consisting of results obtained from one or more
single-cases and that used appropriate single-subject methods with adequate
quantification and analysis of results. The level of evidence of one functional
intervention 46 could not be established due to absence of reliable methodological
control to determine treatment effects. One study was rated as Class II and
consisted of a nonrandomized case-control investigation.48

Overall, among the thirty-nine selected manuscripts, thirty-five studies were rated
as Class III and one study was rated as Class II. The level of evidence of three
functional interventions could not be established due to absence of reliable
methodological control to determine treatment effects.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we conducted a systematic review of the literature aimed at
establishing evidence-based recommendations for the clinical practice of cognitive
rehabilitation for patients with PPA. In order to achieve this, we summarized and
examined the accumulated knowledge concerning non-pharmacological treatments for
patients with PPA. We deliberately chose not to restrict our search to a specific
period of time or to define strict inclusion and exclusion criteria for the studies
in order to gather as many reports as possible. To accomplish this, we singled out
papers from two widely used databases and followed up all relevant references cited
in the selected manuscripts. Even using very inclusive criteria we were able to
report only 39 studies which described treatments applied to 67 patients to date.
This lack of studies was found to be even more critical when we analyzed treatment
alternatives according to specific PPA subtypes. This analysis revealed the scarcity
of reports for NFPPA and LPPA cases.

We organized this section under five topics. Firstly, we discuss separately the main
research findings for SPPA, NFPPA and LPPA variants. Considerations were then made
concerning treatments targeting patients whose impairments either do not conform to
the above-mentioned prototypical syndromes, or were not classified according to the
2011 international consensus, or treatments directed to a group of PPA patients with
no special concern about different subtypes. We then made our concluding comments
and evidence-based recommendations for the clinical practice of cognitive
rehabilitation for patients with PPA.

Non-pharmacological interventions for patients with semantic variant
PPA. We found descriptions of treatments applied to 33 patients with
SPPA.

Functional interventions targeted communication effectiveness through improvement or
maintenance of discursive skills30
or used an ecological-approach aimed at increasing participation in meal
preparation.31 The
strength of these proposals is that they focused on the patients' needs and try to
establish a direct link between therapy practices and performance in daily routine
tasks. Their weakness is the difficulty achieving the necessary experimental control
to measure treatment effects. In their pilot study, Bier et al.31 provided a good example of how
this can be achieved in future research. Despite several limitations imposed by the
patient's personality, authors were able to employ ABA design (baseline condition
followed by treatment and then returning to baseline) and include control tasks and
quantitative measures to determine therapy gains.

Most impairment-directed interventions targeted picture naming skills and lexical
retrieval. Only two studies addressed face-name associations19,26 and another two addressed object use.14,22 It has been shown consistently across studies that SPPA
patients are able to relearn target vocabulary during the active phase of treatment
and to maintain gains above baseline levels for variable periods after ceasing
intervention. This last point, however, needs to be further investigated since
differences in study design and patients' profile (demographic, neuropsychological
and disease duration) preclude drawing conclusions on how long therapy gains are
maintained.

Another point of concern is generalization of learning to untrained stimuli or even
to the same stimuli presented in a different context. Overall, this has not been
achieved (e.g. Snowden and Neary13) with a few exceptions.19,24,25,27,28 This aspect
should be a point of concern when selecting the set of stimuli to be trained and may
also suggest the need for more context-based interventions. Recent studies have
tried to fulfill this need by using personalized materials such as digital photos of
individual household items29 or by
training relevant activities for the patient such as cooking, as in the study of
Bier et al.31 The impact of
interventions on connected speech measures or quality of life has not been
consistently investigated in studies and when reported have shown modest
results.19,20,28 Future
studies should address functional communication measures such as analysis of
discursive skills to reliably establish transference of therapy gains.

Regarding learning mechanisms, studies have shown that patients relearn significantly
more items when they retain residual semantic knowledge about them13,17,28 and are able to
link them to personal experience and context.13 This is said to be due to overreliance on the hippocampus
and adjacent medial temporal lobe structures (episodic memory system) for learning
verbal labels and no reliance on temporal anterior lobe structures (affected by the
disease) crucial for semantic generalization. This view has been recently
challenged.27 By careful
selection of foils the authors showed that patients used verbal labels incorrectly
for foils visually and semantically associated with the target (overgeneralizations)
but not for other types of foils and suggested that the impaired neocortex also
plays a role in SPPA relearning skills. Overall, these findings have practical
implications and suggest that therapy benefits are maximized if interventions start
as early as possible in the presence of very mild semantic memory deficits and low
levels of brain atrophy.

Recent studies experimentally addressed important questions concerning treatment
duration and intervention strategies. It has been shown that longer therapies are
more effective in the maintenance of gains than shorter ones,29 errorless learning is more
effective than errorful learning, but same gains are achieved for active and passive
learning,28 simple
repetition of verbal label leads to similar gains to spaced-retrieval
techniques,18 and simple
picture-word matching leads to similar gains to sentence generation and to providing
definitions for specific items.29
Nevertheless, all these issues need replication in future studies.

It is interesting to note that learning was achieved in SPPA patients after
interventions of a single session;14 individual home-practice,11,12 and
computer-based therapies.24,18 Future studies should compare
these treatments to long-term interventions delivered by a therapist and also to
combined interventions, in order to characterize suitable patients for each therapy
type. Individual home-practice, especially aided by a computer,31 seems to be a very promising
alternative both economically and also in terms of reducing caregivers' load.

Finally, the only study that addressed changes in brain activity after behavioral
interventions in SPPA23 suggested
that patients engage unimpaired structures such as the right superior and inferior
temporal gyrus to compensate for the brain damage. This finding needs to be explored
in more depth by future studies to confirm these results.

Non-pharmacological interventions for patients with NFPPA variant. This
paper presents the results of non-pharmacological treatment applied to 11 patients
in eight articles. With a few exceptions,33,34 most studies
consisted of analyses of treatments applied to a single case.

All three studies that reported functional interventions used Augmentative and
Alternative Communication (AAC) devices.37-39 Although positive
results in communication were reported with these interventions, some patients may
show reluctance to use these tools. For instance, the patient studied by Pattee et
al.39 preferred American
Sign Language and mentioned she did not feel "normal" using the digitized speech
device introduced in the intervention. Moreover, successful long-term therapies
using AAC devices should be described in more detail to be replicated with other
patients. A study described a 4-year intervention without a clear description of the
procedures, therefore rendering it difficult to reproduce.38

Impairment-directed interventions aimed at different aspects in NFPPA:
agrammatism,32
phonological skills,33 apraxia of
speech36 and naming and
lexical retrieval deficits.34,35 Unlike SPPA, most NFPPA patients
presented generalization of therapy gains to some extent, verified in untreated
items,32,34 different tasks33,34 or
functional communication evaluated through self-ratings of treatment
effects.36 These results
are encouraging but need to be replicated in a larger number of patients.

In this variant subtype, only one study evaluated treatment gains through imaging
methods. Using fMRI, Marcotte and Ansaldo35 proposed that adaptive brain plasticity operates
differently in NFPPA and post-stroke lesions, both for spontaneous recovery and
therapy-induced effects. Spontaneous recovery in NFPPA involved bilateral
compensation whereas in the post-stroke patient the right hemisphere was recruited.
After a therapy involving the semantic approach, the authors observed an expansion
of networks involving semantic processing areas (i.e., left middle and superior
temporal gyrus and inferior parietal lobe bilaterally) in the patient with NFPPA,
whereas in the patient with stroke, a contraction of the network occurred involving
phonological processing and speech programming areas. These findings imply different
brain plasticity mechanisms for aphasia depending on etiology (reorganization
post-stroke vs. reactivation in NFPPA) and must be readdressed in future
research.

Non-pharmacological interventions for patients with LPPA. As LPPA has
been only recently described,4 it
is unsurprising that the number of intervention studies with this subtype is still
limited. Only three single-case studies were found, all describing
impairment-directed interventions designed to improve naming/lexical retrieval and
spelling. In addition, we found no studies focusing on discursive abilities. One
possible explanation is that multi-modalities cognitive training directed for the
mixed symptoms of this subtype, linking executive and working memory to discursive
abilities, have yet to be developed.

The three studies found showed significant treatment effects for trained items while
two also demonstrated generalization to untrained items21,40 and also
to conversation skills.40 It is
important to consider that the study which showed limited results41 involved a patient with six years
of disease duration at intervention, a possible explanation for the unremarkable
results observed.

Regarding intervention procedures, Beeson et al.40 attributed the success of their intervention to the
approach employed which was active, errorful and intensive, involving
problem-solving and generation of semantic information to facilitate
lexical-retrieval. This hypothesis must be addressed empirically (as in the study of
Jokel et al.28 with SPPA patients)
and, if confirmed, suggests that naming deficits should be treated with different
approaches according to PPA subtypes.

Lastly, post-treatment fMRI activation changes in an LPPA patient suggest that the
behavioral improvements are supported by increased reliance on the left prefrontal
cortex during word retrieval, thus recruiting relatively unimpaired networks as
compensatory mechanisms.40 As
previously mentioned for studies on the SPPA variant, this finding must be further
explored in future studies.

Non-pharmacological interventions for patients with PPA. We identified
eight studies that reported interventions for 21 patients with PPA. Again, most
studies reported treatments offered to one (five studies) or fewer patients (two
studies) with no special concern about a specific PPA subtype. One exception in this
section, and in the entire review, is the study of Farrajota et al.48 in which speech-therapy gains were
studied by comparing two groups of patients with PPA, one receiving treatment and
another not. This is the first study designed with a control-group of PPA
participants, matched by age, education and language deterioration measures. The
authors used the international consensus classification but did not take subtypes
into consideration when analyzing their results. This poses some limitations to the
interpretation of the findings (i.e. treatment resulted in better naming skills
post-treatment but group not receiving treatment comprised more SPPA patients,
tending to have more severe naming deficits.49

Two studies included patients with atypical profiles and described effective
interventions for dysgraphia44,45. The need for detailed assessment
to design personalized interventions directed to specific cognitive deficits is
emphasized.45 Another
promising alternative for PPA is high-frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic
Stimulation42 and
ecological approaches such as aphasia-friendly TV viewing.47 Both interventions showed positive results but
need replication in a larger number of patients.

Final considerations. We conclude this systematic review attempting to
answer the following questions: [1] Can treatment be beneficial for patients with
PPA and specifically for SPPA, NFPPA and LPPA?; [2] What are the interventions with
sufficient evidence of benefits?

Positive results were reported in all studies included in this review. It is
important to mention that given the nature of the diseases no decline over variable
periods can also be considered a positive outcome. Yet in order to be recommended
these treatments require investigation regarding their efficacy. The approach
characterized by randomized clinical trials is mandatory in the scientific
literature pertaining to evidence-based medicine, but resorting to this approach is
not always feasible when research addresses neuropsychological
rehabilitation50 and, in
particular, language and speech disorders.51 In the case of PPA, most studies consisted of single-case
descriptions, which are very informative but do not allow for extensive
generalization to other groups of patients. However, a large number of studies,
combined with good study design, can help increase the treatments' level of
evidence.

Results of the review of available scientific literature allows for recommendation of
some nonpharmacological interventions for cognitive deficits following PPA. Using
published criteria8 we recommend
impairment-directed therapies aimed at naming and lexical retrieval in SPPA as
Practice Options, based on 18 studies rated as Class III. For treatment aimed at
object use, current evidence is based on two Class III studies. For functional
interventions evidence is drawn from one Class III study. Therefore, more research
is needed before we can reliably recommend these interventions.

Practice recommendations regarding interventions for NFPPA and LPPA are constrained
by the small number of studies and patients that underwent nonpharmacological
interventions reported to date.

Evidence for behavioral therapies aimed at improving typical deficits in NFPPA such
as agrammatism, phonological skills and apraxia of speech is based on one study (for
each deficit) rated as Class III32,33,36 respectively. Evidence from two Class III studies supports
therapy targeting naming deficits34,35 and functional
interventions using AAC37,39 in this group of patients.

The evidence for treatments targeting naming and spelling deficits in LPPA is based
on two Class III studies21,40 and one Class III study,41 respectively.

One Class II study with PPA48
provides evidence that speech therapy can be beneficial for this group of patients
compared to the condition of no treatment.

Generalization of gains has been observed in NFPPA and LPPA but there are very few
reports to date. In SPPA, generalization to untreated items or functional
communication situations has not been consistently reported. In general, better
study design has been employed for impairment-directed interventions, however
functional interventions have strong ecological validity and their gains should be
investigated in further studies.

Post-treatment changes in brain activity have been addressed in only three studies
and findings must be interpreted cautiously and replicated with comparable
techniques and cognitive tasks. The current findings suggest that the brain
plasticity mechanism engaged in therapy is reactivation and that patients recruit
cortical areas that are typically preserved for the specific PPA variant to
compensate for their dysfunctional language networks.

Concerning methodological issues, it is important that single-case studies include
multiple baseline measures, treatment and control stimuli and/or treatment phases in
which multiple measures are taken in the active phase of intervention and compared
to measures when treatment is withdrawn. Long-term follow-up and measuring of
treatment effects, as in the Henry et al.43 and Savage et al.29 studies, is also necessary. Controlled-group studies
comparing interventions to placebo treatments are a challenge in this field but may
be achieved with research collaborations (as in Farrajota et al.48).
