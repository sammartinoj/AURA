challenging to the country's present social and health structures. The
prevalence of dementia in people over 60 years exceeds 8% and is even higher in
the rural population. There is more training on dementia in the local medical

INTRODUCTION
In recent decades, Latin American countries have experienced rapid demographic and
epidemiological transition,1,2 which has led to a rapidly aging
population and increase in the frequency of chronic and degenerative diseases. In
the regional context, Chile is the country whose life expectancy at birth (LEB) has
grown fastest. Between the periods 1970-75 and 2010-2015 LEB increased from 60.5 to
76.5 years in men and from 66.8 to 81.7 years in women.3,4 It is
estimated that the magnitude of the increase in life expectancy seen in Chile,
together with the sustained decline in fertility, currently at 1.9, is set to cause
high sustained growth of the older population.5

In Chile, the absolute number of elderly has more than doubled between 1990, when the
population >60 years was 1179,637 people and 2014, with 2,679,910 people in this
age group. In relative terms, the proportion of people >60 years has increased
from 9% of the total population in 1990 to 14.9% in 2014.3,4 The age
group growing fastest is the 80 years and over bracket whose annual rate of growth
in Latin America and the Caribbean has attained 3.94%.6 This age group in Chile has grown by 130% between
1990 and 2010 (Table 1).

The socioeconomic and health achievements of the country place Chile among the
high-income countries, with a GDP of US$ 21000 (IMF 2014) and health
indicators comparable with western developed countries and the USA. However,
persistent major inequalities in wealth distribution persist with a significant
impact on health indicators of the elderly.7,8 The objective of
this review was to update the information on the problem of dementia in Chile, in
the context of rapid population aging.

Dementia, characterized by a progressive deterioration in intellectual function
affecting functionality, is probably the most feared and devastating disease among
the problems affecting the elderly, representing a major cause of disability and
dependence in older age.

According to the 10/66 dementia research group, dementia is the leading cause of
dependency in older people.9,10 The mean proportion of dependency
attributable to dementia is 36%, followed by limb paralysis/weakness with 11.9% and
stroke with 8.7%. In Chile, the burden of disease study performed in 200711 identified dementia as the third
leading cause of DALYs lost in the 60-74y age group (25,531 DALYs lost), after
cataracts (28,350) and Ischemic Heart disease (26,506), and the second leading cause
of DALYs lost in women.

The 2013 PAHO/WHO estimated prevalence of dementia for Latin America (standardized by
European region population) was 8.5%12 and WHO estimates for the high-income countries in the Southern
cone of Latin America (Argentina, Chile and Uruguay) predicts a 77% increase in
cases of dementia by 2030 and 134-146% for the rest of Latin America. The most
common form of dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD) constituting 60 to 75% of
dementias in the elderly.13,14

The first available population data in Chile is derived from the WHO Age associated
dementias study conducted in Concepción, Chile in 1990-9215 where a crude prevalence of 4.38
(3.57-5.33) was reported.16,17 In the cited study, Alzheimer's
disease was the most common type of dementia, accounting for 85% of the cases. The
latest population data available about dementias in the country and its contribution
to the burden of disease in the elderly in Chile is from the National Survey of
Dependency (NSD) in the elderly. The NSD was conducted in 2010 in a representative
sample of 4860 people 60y and older.18 Briefly, the NSD study was a cross-sectional survey, carried
out in a probabilistic sample of independent-living older adults, 60 years and
older, residents of all Chilean Regions. A stratified, multi-stage sampling design,
with selection proportional to population size, was the method applied, ensuring the
participation of people from both urban and rural areas. From within each
municipality, sectors (and subsequently households) were selected randomly. The
population of 80 years and older was oversampled to allow for a more precise
estimation of dependency in this growing sector of the Chilean population. The study
was approved by the Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology, University of Chile
Ethics Committee. Dementia was defined using the test validated in the WHO Age
associated dementias study in Concepción, consisting of a score<22 on the
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)19 and a score>5 on the Pfeffer activities
questionnaire20 with
sensitivity of 94.4% (95%CI: 70.6-99.7) and specificity of 83.3% (95%CI:
72.3-90.7).21 Symptoms of
Depression were evaluated with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15)22 adopting a cut point >4 as
positive screening.

The total crude prevalence of dementia in people 60y and older observed was 7.0%
(women 7.7%; men 5.9%; p=0.15) and proved higher in rural than in urban samples
(10.3% vs 6.3%; p=0.002 (Table 2).

Table 2 Prevalence (%) of dementia by age group, in urban and rural samples and in
men and women.

In both men and women, there is a significant increase in the prevalence of dementia
with increasing age (p<0.0001). The same situation was observed in both urban and
rural samples (p<0.002).


Figure 1 shows a strong negative association of
dementia with years of education (p<0.001). Dementia prevalence in illiterates is
25.2% while the rate in subjects with >13 years of schooling is only 1.2%.

Table 3 shows the proportion of dependence
attributable to dementia by gender and area of residence. Around one third of
dependency is attributable to dementia, except among men from urban areas where the
percentage is lower (27%).

The adjusted model for dementia showed no association with gender but an independent
positive association with rurality and age as well as a negative association with
educational level attained (Table 4). The
strongest association was observed for age with an OR=10.75 for the 80y and older
group in comparison with the 60-69 years-old group, followed by education (OR=2.76)
in the group with less than 8 y of schooling compared to the group with 8 y or
more.

In a subsample of 287 people (50% women) of Mapuche ethnicity, a higher crude
prevalence of dementia was found than in individuals of non-Mapuche origin (10.9% vs
6.9%, p<0.02). This association persisted after adjusting for age, sex and
educational level (OR=1.6;95% CI 1.06-2.44) as shown in Table 5. However, these results should be interpreted with
caution considering that the diagnostic instruments used have not been validated in
the Mapuche people.

Based on the prevalence of dementia observed in the present study, the population
estimates from the National Institute of Statistics (INE 2014), and considering the
estimated increase in life expectancy (United Nations 2010) over the same period,
the estimated number of people with dementia was 150,293 in 2010, 181,761 by 2015
reaching 533,188 by 2050 (Figure 2). The
estimated number of dementia cases was determined considering the prevalences of
dementia by age group found in this survey and in the population at large.

Progress to date. Currently, there is no national strategy in Chile for
dementia while existing governmental health programmes, such as the National Program
for the Elderly or the Mental Health Program, have devoted scant attention to
initiatives aimed at the healthcare of persons with dementia. Recent governments
have shown no greater sensitivity to the problem and have given it only secondary
priority. However, a new workgroup is now in place within the Ministry of Health
with the aim of creating a future National Dementia Plan. In 2002, the government
established an organization called SENAMA (Servicio Nacional del Adulto Mayor)
tasked with improving the quality of life for older people, taking a gerontological
perspective; this institution has supported public dementia-related initiatives such
as the first Day Care Center for people with dementia in the country, named
Kintun,24 located in the
municipality of Peñalolen in Santiago intended for families of limited
means.

Only a few private clinics or large hospitals, concentrated in major cities, have
integral units for the diagnosis and treatment of dementia with multidisciplinary
professional teams. At the primary care level, there are basic standards and
clinical guidelines for cognitive impairment and dementia: a screening instrument
called EFAM (Functional Assessment of the Elderly) is in routine use, validated for
use in the local setting, which allows the detection of older adults in the
community who are at risk of losing functionality in the short and medium term and
enables categorization by level of independence.23 Furthermore, since 2008 the Preventive Medical Examination
for the Elderly (EMPAM) has been in place, as part of the so-called GES guarantee or
AUGE (80 pathologies included): this provides a comprehensive benefits package, free
and guaranteed to be delivered both in the public and private health systems; it
prioritizes certain diseases, but has not yet incorporated dementia despite its
recognized disease burden.

At higher levels of health complexity, there are memory clinics in public hospitals,
where patients with cognitive disorders can be examined adequately and a probable
diagnosis reached within a reasonable timeframe. However, therapeutic options are
limited since it is not possible to prescribe approved anti-dementia medication as a
result of absence of central funding. Neither are cognitive stimulation programmes
readily available, although there are many memory workshops at the county level for
cognitively healthy individuals. Appropriate psychotropic drugs for the management
of neuropsychiatric symptoms are equally difficult to prescribe under the public
system. In general, people with dementia experiencing significant behavioural change
have poor access to inpatient care in public hospitals. There are virtually no
health structures that can be classed as acute psychogeriatrics units, and the only
public hospital in the country specializing in older adults, the Geriatrics National
Institute, has major limitations in physical and human resources.

It is noteworthy that the diagnosis and treatment of patients with dementia is mainly
carried out by neurologists and geriatricians and only a very small proportion are
diagnosed by psychiatrists. Additionally, in recent years there has been little
interest in the study and management of mental disorders in the elderly within
specialist training, despite the obvious increase in prevalence of these
diseases.

There are about 1700 long-term care homes; half of them concentrated in the capital
and a third informal.25 Most are
private and others, run by religious or philanthropic organizations, receive some
support from the state. It is clear that the majority of patients with advanced
dementia are being cared for by relatives. Day hospitals and day-care centers for
patients with cognitive disorders are scarce.

Chile has only three or four research centres in neuroscience applied to
neurodegenerative diseases (the University of Chile, the Catholic University and the
University of Concepcion) able to compete internationally. Moreover, in the last
decade, the country has become an important platform in Latin America for conducting
clinical trials with new anti-dementia drugs at various stages of development. A
significant contribution regarding training, management and care is provided by the
relevant scientific societies and the local association of family volunteers
(Corporación Alzheimer Chile). The Society of Neurology, Psychiatry and
Neurosurgery of Chile as well as the Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology of Chile
collaborate in various workgroups and provide training and information to
professionals and community representatives through courses, publications and media
campaigns highlighting the enormous challenges Chilean society is set to face in the
near future. For 20 years or so, the Corporation Alzheimer Chile, affiliated with
Alzheimer's Disease International, has provided education, medical care and
psychological support to families and caregivers, particularly those on low
incomes.

There is growing interest in incorporating psychogeriatric training on cognitive
impairment and dementia into under and postgraduate curricula of health professions
in most academic institutions, both public and private. In the short-term, this is
expected to reverse the current low level of training of both professionals and
non-professionals providing mental health care to older adults.

Chile is facing an ageing population and consequently a steep increase in the
incidence and prevalence of dementia, a problem typical of developed countries.
However, the dementia challenge is being faced by a system applying standards more
typically encountered in developing countries. Socioeconomic inequality and the
structure and dynamics of the country's healthcare system prevent delivery of
quality care to the majority of those affected by dementia.8 Hence, even small improvements in
the various agencies and systems will lead to important redress in the medium
term.

Current key needs. The increasing health problems in aging societies
pose large potential demand for health services and expose Ministries of health in
Latin America to a significant increase in the health-care budget. The enormous cost
of the disease is a challenge for health systems given the predicted increase in
prevalence. The accelerated aging of the Chilean population, particularly the group
of 80y and older, and the growing number of cases of dementia reported poses a huge
challenge to the country. It is imperative to anticipate the growing and urgent
demand for a particularly vulnerable group often forgotten and discriminated.

People with dementia live for many years after the first symptoms of the disease.
With appropriate support many of them can and should be able to continue
participating and contributing to society and to have a good quality of life. In
this context, early detection of the disease and the design of programmes aimed at
combatting reversible risk factors while stimulating protective factors should be a
priority for the public health policies in the country.

A particularly concerning issue is the lack of specialists in mental health for the
elderly. Therefore, the training at different levels of complexity for all health
workers who work, or will work, with these patients is a matter of national
priority. Also, qualified staff and investment in infrastructure and technology will
be vital to achieve earlier diagnosis and more effective future therapeutic
interventions.

Optimum coordination of social and support networks leveraging the existing community
will also be crucial for families and caregivers. All these interventions of urgent
implementation must be synchronized with a change in social culture toward greater
inclusion of the frail and reducing stigmas.

Finally, interventions aimed at caring for people with dementia are required
urgently. Although the proportion of elders living alone remains low (15%), the
changing patterns of the population structure will impact living arrangements in the
future, with a substantial reduction in family size and consequently, in the
availability of family caregivers. Dementia is stressful for caregivers, who need
proper support from the financial, legal, social and health systems.

In the NSD, a high burden of care was associated with dementia of the care-recipient
and low social support to the caregiver. The high burden of caregivers is a cause of
concern. When caregiving is performed under conditions of poverty, without breaks,
training and resources for care along with a lack of institutional or social
support, there is a high risk of associated morbidity as a result of caregivers
missing out on preventive health programmes (mammogram, pap smear, etc.), increased
depression rates and decreased immunity. The risk of neglect and abuse is also
increased with an overwhelmed caregiver.

The process of population ageing in developing countries has important economic and
social consequences. Our societies are getting older faster than developed nations,
but in a context of poverty, unequal economic distribution and gender inequality. To
face these challenges, timely and integral social policies for pensions, housing and
healthcare are required.
